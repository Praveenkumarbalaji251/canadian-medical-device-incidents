BRAUN MELSUNGEN AG INTERNAL REPORT (B)(4). THE DEVICE HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED IN OUR SERVICE DEPARTMENT AT B. BRAUN MELSUNGEN AG, MELSUNGEN, GERMANY: 1. GENERAL INFORMATION: COMPLAINT: (B)(4). 2. INFORMATION TO THE SAMPLE: 2.1 MODEL: INFUSOMAT SPACE 2.2 ARTICLE NUMBER: 8713050 2.3 SERIAL NUMBER/BATCH: 266725 2.4 SOFTWARE VERSION: M030002 2.5 HOURS OF OPERATION: 11524 H 2.6 FURTHER INFORMATION: N/A 3. INVESTIGATION RESULTS: 3.1 HISTORY INSPECTION: THE DEVICE HISTORY FILES WERE READ OUT AND ANALYZED. (DATE OF THE INCIDENT: 2022-06-15). THE HISTORY FILES OF 2022-06-15 WERE INVESTIGATED. AT 02:48 AM A SPACE LINE WAS INSERTED. AT 02:53 AM THE RATE WAS SET TO 100 ML/H. A FEW SECONDS LATER THE DRUGLIBARY NAMED H SANTA HELENA 2021 WAS SET. THE DRUG SHORT NAME NORA (NORADRENALIN) WAS SELECTED. THE RATE WAS SET TO 3 ML/H AND THE VTBI TO 80 ML. THEN THE INFUSION WAS STARTED. BETWEEN 02:53 AM AND 08:34 AM THE INFUSION WAS STARTED AND STOPPED TWO TIMES. FURTHERMORE, THE RATES WERE CHANGED SEVERAL TIMES. AT 08:34 AM THE DEVICE ALARM 2112 (START FROM FUP NOT IN TIME) WAS DISPLAYED. INSIDE THE KEYBOARD HISTORY FILES IT COULD BE DETECTED THAT THE START/STOP BUTTON WAS PRESSED IN THE SAME SECOND TWO TIMES, BEFORE THE DEVICE ALARM 2112 WAS DISPLAYED. (REASON FOR THE DOUBLE PRESS COULD NOT BE CLARIFIED). 3.2 STATEMENT FROM R&D THE DEVICE DATA WAS SENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT FOR FURTHER INVESTIGATION. STATEMENT FROM DEVELOPMENT: THE DEVICE ALARM 2112 (LINE 3220, 15.06.2022, 08:34:20) OCCURS WHEN THE STATEMENT OF START FROM THE FUNCTION PROCESSOR IS NOT IN TIME. THE KEYBOARD HISTORY SHOWS (LINE 80/81, 15.06.2022, 08:34:19 ) THAT THE START/STOP BUTTON WAS PRESSED TWICE IN RAPID SUCCESSION. THIS WAS THE REASON FOR AN UNDEFINED START-STATE AND FOR THE DEVICE ALARM 2112. THIS DEVICE ALARM CAN APPEAR IF THE START STOP BUTTON IS PRESSED TWICE IN RAPID SUCCESSION (< 0,5 SECONDES) WHEN STOPPING THE INFUSION. A HARDWARE DEFECT CAN BE RULED OUT AT THIS POINT. 3.3 VISUAL INSPECTION: A VISUAL INSPECTION WAS PERFORMED. THE COVER CAPS ON THE SCREW PILLARS, AND THE TECHNICAL SEAL (55-02-042) ON THE LOWER HOUSING WERE INTACT AND UNDAMAGED. THE DEVICE SHOWS AGE RELATED SIGNS OF WEAR AND TEAR. FURTHERMORE, LIQUID RESIDUES COULD BE DETECTED AT THE OUTSIDE. THE OPERATING UNIT SHOWS PRESSURE POINTS. THOSE IDENTIFIES AN EXTERNAL FORCE DAMAGE. IN ADDITION, NO MORE ANOMALIES COULD BE FOUND. 3.4 FUNCTIONAL INSPECTION: A FUNCTIONAL TEST WAS PERFORMED. THE DEVICE PASSED THE SELF-TEST. A SPACE LINE WAS INSERTED, THE PUMP IDENTIFIED THE LINE, AND IT COULD BE SELECTED FROM THE MENU. IT WAS POSSIBLE TO PUT THE PUMP IN OPERATION. A LOUD RATTLING DURING THE INFUSION COULD BE DETECTED. THE RATTLING IS DUE TO LIQUID RESIDUES INSIDE THE SLIDE GUIDE. 3.5 PRESSURE INSPECTION: FOR CHECKING THE DOWNSTREAM SENSOR, THE ELECTRONIC PRESSURE CUT-OFF AND THE MECHANICAL PRESSURE LIMITATION OF THE DEVICE WERE TESTED, ACCORDING TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE TECHNICAL SAFETY CHECK. THE DEVICE MATCHES THE REQUIRED VALUES AND STANDARDS. ALL MEASURED VALUES ARE WITHIN OUR SPECIFICATION. 3.6 FLOW RATE INSPECTION: A DELIVERY ACCURACY MEASUREMENT ACCORDING TO IEC 60601-2-24 WAS ARRANGED. HERE A NOMINAL FLOW RATE OF 100 ML/H WAS CHOSEN. THE ASSESSED MEAN DEVIATION ""A"" OF THE SECOND OPERATING HOUR WAS MEASURED AND RESULTED IN A VALUE OF -0,35%. THE ACCURACY OF SET DELIVERY RATE SHOULD BE: ± 5 % ACCORDING TO IEC/EN 60601-2-24. THE DEVICE MATCHES THE REQUIRED VALUES AND STANDARDS. ALL MEASURED VALUES ARE WITHIN OUR SPECIFICATION. 3.7 INDIVIDUAL INSPECTION: DATE OF THE INCIDENT: 2022-06-15 FOR CHECKING THE DEVICE ALARM 2112, THE HISTORY ENTRIES WERE READJUSTED WITH THE PUMP. THE DEVICE ALARM 2112 COULD NOT BE REPRODUCED. NO ANOMALIES COULD BE DETECTED. 3.8 DISASSEMBLING: TO INVESTIGATE THE INSIDE, THE DEVICE WAS DISASSEMBLED COMPLETELY. THE BATTERY PACK SHOWS LIQUID RESIDUES AT THE OUT- AND INSIDE. INSIDE THE BATTERY PACK OXIDIZED CONTACTS COULD BE FOUND. THE RIBBON CABLE THAT CONNECTS THE BATTERY PACK WITH THE MAINBOARD SHOWS DAMAGED PARTS. THE DAMAGED RIBBON CABLE IS DUE TO A WRONG BENDING. INSIDE THE DEVICE MANY LIQUID RESIDUES COULD BE DETECTED. NO LIQUID RESIDUES AT THE MAINBOARD COULD BE FOUND. THE RIBBON CABLE THAT CONNECTS THE OPERATING UNIT WITH THE MAINBOARD WAS NOT INSERTED CORRECTLY INTO THE ZERO CRAFT CONNECTOR. FURTHERMORE, NO ANOMALIES INSIDE THE DEVICE COULD BE DETECTED. 4. JUDGMENT: 4.1 THE COMPLAINT COULD BE CONFIRMED. THE STOP OF THE INFUSION IS DUE TO A DEVICE ALARM (2112). THE DEVICE ALARM IS CAUSED BY A SOFTWARE ERROR, WHICH WAS CAUSED BY THE USER. THE DAMAGED PARTS (LIQUID RESIDUES AND EXTERNAL FORCE DAMAGE) COULD NOT PRODUCE THE DEVICE ALARM 2112. , Description of Event or Problem:AS REPORTED BY THE USER FACILITY INFORMATION BY BBM SALES ORGANIZATION IN BRAZIL: ""STOPPED WORKING.""
