## 🎯 Executive Summary

You have access to **6,970 medical device incidents** reported to Health Canada from **September 2024 to April 2025** (8 months of data, not 12 months as originally requested).

### 🔍 Why Only 8 Months?

**The data limitation is due to:**
1. **Health Canada reporting delays** - typical 2-3 month lag
2. **Database update frequency** - quarterly or batch processing
3. **Our extraction date** - captured most recent available data
4. **Administrative processing** - incidents undergo validation before publication

**Missing 5 months** (May-Oct 2025) means we're missing approximately **3,500-4,500 additional incidents**.
