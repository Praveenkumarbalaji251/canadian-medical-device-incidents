I’ve tried switching to activity mode, tried announcing only 1/2 carbs, tried eating without bolusing, tried eating before activity starts and so on, all suggestions by my doc for avoiding lows while on the pump. But nothing is working 😭 Today the only time I bolused was when I had my iced coffee in the morning, and then early evening I had a feta wrap from Starbucks. For both of these I only bolused a whopping 1 unit each. The rest of the day I didn’t bolus for anything and yet I still go low. I’ve dropped to 40 twice today 😭 and literally every day I am stuffing my face with gummy worms, which makes me feel so bad. Anyone go thru this?",

          "selftext": "We live in the greater Boston area, rely on heat pumps for heating, and have had three compressor (+ two control board) failures of our Mitsubishi outdoor unit since the system was installed four years ago. We're seeking advice on what we should be asking the company that's coming next week to assess the system. We're at our wits end and hugely regret not just sticking with oil. We bought our house in August 2020. It's 1,800 square feet, built in the 1920s, and as well-insulated as a house its age can be. In November 2020, Company A - a Mitsubishi Diamond contractor with good online reviews - installed ductless Mitsubishi heat pumps as a complete replacement for our failing oil-based heating system; Company A assured us that a backup system was unnecessary and removed our ancient oil boiler and tank. The outside unit is MXZ-8C60NA2-U1 and we have five heads inside. Over the 2020-2021 winter we felt there were problems with the system's operation (using a lot of electricity for relatively little heat) but Company A fobbed us off, saying that everything was normal. In June 2021, seven months after it was installed, our system stopped working completely. Company A, after consulting with Mitsubishi, diagnosed a control board failure in the outside unit. They replaced the control board, but the system remained non-functional. After further discussion with Mitsubishi, they diagnosed a compressor failure and ultimately, Company A replaced the whole outside unit. The system continued to work as before, never really heating the house sufficiently, but we had Company A's assurances that it was working as intended. Fast forward 1.5 years to December 2023, when our system stopped working again. Company A, after initially misdiagnosing the issue as a coolant leak, consulted with Misubishi and diagnosed a control board failure. Again, they replaced the control board, but the system remained non-functional. Then Mitsubishi said the compressor had also failed, so Company A replaced the compressor too. To cut a long story short, Company A was unable to explain why two outdoor units had failed in quick succession, unwilling to investigate, and more generally, very challenging to work with (they had also been responsible for two coolant leaks in December 2020 due to issues in the installation). Hence we decided to use a different company for servicing and maintenance going forward, Company B, also a Mitsubishi diamond contractor. In early 2024, we paid Company B to assess our system as we had no confidence in Company A's work or judgement. We had noticed that the new compressor was much louder than the previous two had been, but otherwise the system operated as before. Company B said everything seemed normal. Then early last week - January 2025, 13 months since the last failure - the system stopped working again. Company B sent a technician out and consulted with Mitsubishi, who said the (third!) compressor needs to be replaced. We aren't comfortable replacing yet another compressor without figuring out why this keeps happening. It's immensely stressful. Company B is sending a technician next week to do a more thorough assessment. It's been really cold the last week (down to 0 fahrenheit some nights). We had our 48,000 BTU wood stove going continuously for the first few days after the heat pumps failed, but are now just relying on five standard oil-filled electric space heaters. They are keeping the house warmer than the heat pumps ever did and using about the same amount of electricity. At this point, we're looking for advice on what questions we should be asking Company B next week to help prevent us from being back in the same situation again in a year's time. Additional context: In 2020/2021, we experienced lights flickering in the house and after the first unit failed, we wondered if electrical issues had contributed (Company A did not suggest this as an explanation - they guessed that we just had a faulty unit). We hired an electrician to assess our electrical system and he said everything was fine inside the house, but he suggested contacting the supplier, Eversource, in case the issue was with the supply. We hired another electrician for a second opinion and he said the same thing. Ultimately, after multiple calls and emails from us, Eversource replaced the service wires coming into the house, found two neutrals at the transmission box and fixed that issue, and replaced the transformer on the street and secondary leads. Apparently none of the issues they found should have caused the unit to fail, and in any event, the latter two failures happened well after this work was complete.",

Got down and noticed it was a double drip which was odd. Nonetheless, coolant. I had apparently lost almost all the coolant in the overflow tank it was right beneath it so I guess the leak was bad. I had noticed last week a white dried puddle in my parking space but because it’s a open driveway and all sorts of idiots can pull into the space when I’m at work; I don’t take too much from it. But I topped the coolant off, the SUC never ran hot which shocked the hell out of me. After doing some research I knew it was the trusty ol’ water pump so I didn’t use the SUV much to protect it. Dropped it off to the dealer on Tuesday, didn’t have to pay the $100 deductible for MaxCare as fine 5/60k Powertrain Warranty still is active til end of an August of this year. Changed water pump and addressed a hose per the work order. Thermostat and radiator was fine. All and all, I read about the water pumps going back on our SUVs and was waiting for it once I crossed 35k. Service was efficient, SUV seems to be back to normal. I had a 2024 Hornet R/T and while it has crazy acceleration and tech, it’s too small for anyone over 5’10” and with more than 1 kid. Very quick though, I’m glad Dodge in Hawaii isn’t only relying on Enterprise for loaners for warranty jobs and got cars on the lot. Really makes things move quicker.",

Fujitsu's response over this prolonged failure was nonchalant at best. The distributor was equally unpreturbed by a $22,000 system that couldn't stay running for more than a few days. As was the dealer. It failed again, and we've got a bunch of electric heaters keeping the space from freezing. The dealer has finally agreed to remove it and replace it with a system from Ecoer. Which is great, since it will save on lawyer bills So, two questions. 1.Has anyone had similar dificulties with Fujitsu heap pumps? I noticed that Fujitsu is mad eager to sell off the Fujitsu America division. Having failed so far to find a buyer, I assume cutting costs to maximize profit is more important than customer service. For whatever reason, they set a new low in all my experience. 2. Does anyone have any experience with Ecoer? I'll be getting a newly released 3rd Gen system. Thanks in advance for any information!",

To try and pin it down I had been seeing usage patterns when I turn off breakers. There is a breaker labeled \"pump\" that I had off for about a day before my toilet stopped flushing so now I know what that breaker does. I am in a converted basement in a house built in SF in the \\~1930s. I know from a previous Tennant that this door they boarded up in my closet goes to a space that is roughly right behind the bathroom which allegedly opens right into a hole in the ground that is presumably the sewer. As near as I can tell this basement was used as a unit as early as the 80s but it could've been sooner. Another observation is that the shower has been draining slowly for over a year now. I do not think I remember that happening earlier but ive snaked+drain-oed it with no improvement. The only reason I mention is in the off chance that the pump is involved in the showers draining somehow. The drain is very shallow and narrow very quickly. Anywho the reason I ask in r/AskElectricians is I am curious if you've ever seen a case where a pump malfunction of some sort has resulted in the toilet using extra electricity.",

          "selftext": "Just wanted to share my experience of tandem x2 pump failure and replacement. I've had the X2 for 3.5 years. Haven't had any issues until now when I was on holiday in Morocco. I suddenly got a Malfunction 9-0x20F1 - this was my first malfunction ever. Some research with ChatGPT revealed that per Tandem website this is a resettable alert. So I followed the procedure to reset: https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/support-center/pumps-and-supplies/tslimx2-insulin-pump/article/malfunction-code-message-on-tslimx2 After reset, things worked again, but then I got a \"Cartridge Alert\" which requires putting in a new cartridge. I replaced the cartridge and things worked for an hour or so, then I got another Cartridge Alert. I replaced again, got another Malfunction 9-0x20F1. Did another reset, but afterwards kept getting Cartridge Alerts. It took maybe around a day to realize that the pump was a goner from first malfunction/alert to it being unusable. Luckily, I had packed basal and bolus pens - expired by 2 years or so but the insulin still works, maybe some few percent decayed but it doesn't matter 😁 Until now I'd always thought I was a bit paranoid to take the pens, I didn't expect the pump to fail out of the blue. Replacement seems to work with a caveat: I called the 24h customer service hotline (for Germany where I got the pump) and it took barely 10min to arrange the replacement. They'll ship it, but only to the EU. I'll have to return the pump within 14 days - return label only works from EU. That's very important to bear in mind if you plan to travel. Worst case you'll be without pump for the entire trip abroad. This is really not great if you go backpacking for 3 months: now you need to take enough insulin for the pump and for pens. Might make sense to use the pen cartridges for filling the cartridges to not have to take double insulin. If you travel far and the pump fails it can be a major inconvenience. If you've just started your trip, might make sense to get a relative to accept the pump in your country then send with courier to wherever you are. You might also have to send the pump back with courier. DHL or likewise might allow to do that within 2 weeks to anywhere on the globe for say 200 USD both ways. This is my first pump so I unfortunately don't have a spare one I could have taken. In the future, for long trips, I might take an old pump as backup. Update: I learned that even for Germany, free loaner pumps for travel are available. I had no clue this existed before seeing it mentioned on this forum. They should really tell people during the mandatory training.

          "selftext": "If you’re a Tandem Mobi insulin pump user, you need to be aware of a serious and potentially life-threatening malfunction that can leave you stranded without insulin. This is not just a minor glitch—it’s a critical failure that could put lives at risk. The Malfunction: What Happens? For seemingly no apparent reason, the pump will begin beeping and vibrating every five minutes, alerting you that something is wrong. The lights on the pump will flash red continuously or possibly stay solid, indicating a total system failure. When this happens: • All insulin delivery stops immediately—both basal insulin and bolus doses cannot be administered. • You cannot silence the alarms or dismiss the error. • The pump will not restart without specific steps that require equipment you likely don’t have on you while away from home. This means that if you are out for the day, at work, traveling, or even just a few hours from home without backup insulin, you’re in serious trouble. High blood sugar, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and hospitalization become real risks. Restarting the Pump: A Frustrating Process The only way to fix this issue is to: 1. Place the pump on its charging pad. 2. Hold the Quick Bolus button for about 30 seconds until it turns off. 3. Ensure the pump has a proper connection with the charger—it will vibrate slightly when aligned correctly. 4. Wait 1-2 minutes for it to restart. But here’s the problem: Who carries a charging pad with them everywhere? When you’re out for the day, you don’t expect your life-saving medical device to completely shut down, requiring a bulky charger to restart. Tandem’s response? Just carry a backup insulin plan. Tandem’s Response: Do They Even Care? When reporting this issue to Tandem Diabetes Care, their response was shockingly dismissive. Their policy states: • If the malfunction happens three times, they will replace the pump. • However, the replacement is likely a refurbished unit, which could have its own issues. • Customer service representatives offer no real solution beyond telling users to carry backup insulin. This should not be happening with a life-sustaining medical device. The entire purpose of an insulin pump is to reduce the burden of diabetes management—not to leave users stranded without insulin in a dangerous medical emergency. A Widespread Issue? It’s unclear how many people are experiencing these failures, but reports are appearing across online communities. Reddit, diabetes forums, and social media are full of users encountering similar issues, receiving the same inadequate response from Tandem. If this is happening to you, it’s critical to report it so that regulators and advocacy groups take action. What Can Be Done? If you experience this issue, here’s what you should do: 1. Report the malfunction to Tandem—even if they don’t seem to care, having records of complaints matters. 2. File a complaint with the FDA’s MedWatch program (FDA MedWatch)—this is how device failures get officially documented. 3. Contact diabetes advocacy groups like JDRF, the American Diabetes Association, or Beyond Type 1 to raise awareness. 4. Warn others in the diabetes community about this issue so they can be prepared. 5. Consider switching to a different insulin pump brand—companies with better reliability and customer service exist. Final Thoughts: This Should NOT Be Happening Tandem’s insulin pumps are marketed as advanced, reliable medical devices, yet they are failing at a basic level—providing uninterrupted insulin delivery. When failure occurs, users are left without immediate solutions and a customer service team that downplays the seriousness of the issue. If you rely on a Tandem Mobi insulin pump, be prepared. Bring a backup insulin plan, carry a charging pad if possible, and document any malfunctions. Most importantly, demand better from Tandem and the FDA—because no one with diabetes should have to fight for their safety against the very devices meant to keep them alive.",

Has anyone else ran into this issue before? I don’t have a backup pump… and while I do have insulin vials, I have not been on shots forever. I also don’t have long lasting insulin. Is there a really fast way to obtain an insulin pump? Possibly a used database of old pumps for an affordable price? I am inquiring about ordering a new pump from Tandem, but I’m not sure what the insurance coverage and cost is going to look like. The Tandem rep also said that ordering a brand new pump does have several steps involved and it does take awhile to actually receive the pump. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",

In the past, Dexcom has replaced these with no issues, but when I just called for replacements today, I was told I am limited to 3 a year for any replacement that essentially isn't provably the fault of Dexcom (I guess bad adhesive doesn't count). After that, you pay full price or have to otherwise work it out with insurance. HOWEVER, if you report that the sensor itself failed, they replace without limit, as long as you can provide the product information of the \"failed' sensor. I was told that you need to send in the failed products in some cases (such as an unexplained loss of signal) but you don't have to send the sensors back in for issues such as an error code or inaccurate readings. So if someone were to say...report that their sensor gave inaccurate readings, they could get it replaced with no proof or evidence, as long as they provide serial number and other product info. TL;DR: Dexcom will only replace 3 sensors a year for free for adhesive failures, but there are unlimited replacements with no evidence required for inaccurate readings (as long as you report the product info for the \"faulty\" sensor).",

I here is extremely difficult if not almost impossible to get them to replace sensors that don't work. I tried just buying some outright, they are very expensive and only available outside of the supply company with his insurance at inflated prices and sus small online companies I am not sure about giving my credit card information to. In addition Byram health said they have a Dexcom G7 shortage now and can only send three at time. They told 3 times over that our three were on teh way, but they are still not sent and won't be until the 7/18 due to the shortage. They are also charging us about 40 dollars a sensor despite having full coverage insurance that covers pump supplies, insulin and etc. My son is 19 with high functioning Autism. He works full time as a Janitor and is not going to do well at work without a CGM on. It will be hard for him to keep finger sticking himself, but we at the point where assuming we don't get any more lemons for a while (and we def will get more lemons) we will be about 20 days coming up without a sensor on at all. He is type one on a pump and needs to be on the pump. Any advice on how to get cgm that work with a tandem modi pump by any means? Is there another brand? Is there a way to buy some for cash? Is there a way to get through Dexcom's impossible costumer service and force their hand on replacement? does anyone have extra unused G7 censors? Thanks,",

I've recently found out Dexcom One plus is available with my insurance, and thought about changing, so I bought one and used it for the past week along my Medtronic CGM. What I found was: PROs: - Dexcom's application process and warm up time are great compared to Medtronic (simple all-in-one insertion along with 30min warm-up period vs complicated insertion process and 2h warmup for Medtronic) - Customizable alert sounds for hipo/hiper (big plus for me being able to have an alert that rings for a longer time during the night) - better reports, seeing time in range directly in the app. - smaller, better looking CONs: - Accuracy was not great in the first 3 days on Dexcom 1+, even though I tried calibrating it. - Lack of \"low soon\" or \"falling / trending down\" alerts. - Lack of bypassing volume settings (so that all alerts are at Max volume) How do you feel about these negative points? Are they a big deal for you? Have you found a workaround for them? I really want to change, but the lack of low soon alerts are actually feeling really important to me. Thanks!",

Do I just suck it up and keep giving myself a shot every 30 mins for the next few days? Even doing that my blood isn’t going below 220ish, the highest it’s gotten today was 250.

Since March I've been noticing an ever-increasing dependency on my bolus (Novolog) and correcting my highs. I was using about 5 units of Novolog a day (10 units Lantus in the morning), and then it went up to 9-11 units a day, and now I'm pushing 16 to 20 units. I thought perhaps the vial had gone bad, so I swapped out for a new one, but no luck. Has anyone experienced issues with the Tslim failing to give you the full amount of insulin?

          "selftext": "Just wanted to share my experience of tandem x2 pump failure and replacement. I've had the X2 for 3.5 years. Haven't had any issues until now when I was on holiday in Morocco. I suddenly got a Malfunction 9-0x20F1 - this was my first malfunction ever. Some research with ChatGPT revealed that per Tandem website this is a resettable alert. So I followed the procedure to reset: https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/support-center/pumps-and-supplies/tslimx2-insulin-pump/article/malfunction-code-message-on-tslimx2 After reset, things worked again, but then I got a \"Cartridge Alert\" which requires putting in a new cartridge. I replaced the cartridge and things worked for an hour or so, then I got another Cartridge Alert. I replaced again, got another Malfunction 9-0x20F1. Did another reset, but afterwards kept getting Cartridge Alerts. It took maybe around a day to realize that the pump was a goner from first malfunction/alert to it being unusable. Luckily, I had packed basal and bolus pens - expired by 2 years or so but the insulin still works, maybe some few percent decayed but it doesn't matter 😁 Until now I'd always thought I was a bit paranoid to take the pens, I didn't expect the pump to fail out of the blue. Replacement seems to work with a caveat: I called the 24h customer service hotline (for Germany where I got the pump) and it took barely 10min to arrange the replacement. They'll ship it, but only to the EU. I'll have to return the pump within 14 days - return label only works from EU. That's very important to bear in mind if you plan to travel. Worst case you'll be without pump for the entire trip abroad. This is really not great if you go backpacking for 3 months: now you need to take enough insulin for the pump and for pens. Might make sense to use the pen cartridges for filling the cartridges to not have to take double insulin. If you travel far and the pump fails it can be a major inconvenience. If you've just started your trip, might make sense to get a relative to accept the pump in your country then send with courier to wherever you are. You might also have to send the pump back with courier. DHL or likewise might allow to do that within 2 weeks to anywhere on the globe for say 200 USD both ways. This is my first pump so I unfortunately don't have a spare one I could have taken. In the future, for long trips, I might take an old pump as backup. Update: I learned that even for Germany, free loaner pumps for travel are available. I had no clue this existed before seeing it mentioned on this forum. They should really tell people during the mandatory training.

          "selftext": "I know the debate over which pump is best gets brought up a lot, so I'm sorry for throwing it out there again - I'm just trying to do my due diligence so I don't make a bad decision. The warranty on my Tslim just expired so I went to see my diabetes educator to get the ball rolling on getting a replacement. I went in 95% sure I wanted to stick with Tandem but the educator said she didn't want me to discount Medtronic so quickly. She said she finds the algorithms on the Medtronic pumps to be better than Tandems. When I brought up that I had heard a lot of complaints about the newer Medtronic pumps, she said most of the complaints were about the CGM, which is also most of the complaints I see. She said normally she wouldn't necessarily recommend Medtronic over Tandem except that in the next few months Medtronic is going to release their new CGM as well as making their pumps compatible with the Libre 3, so that if I decided to go with Medtronic I wouldn't be stuck with the current crappy CGM for too long. I've been *mostly* pleased with my Tandem/G6 pairing. But there are times where Tandem's control IQ algorithm does things that I don't agree with, sometimes leading to hypos. And also Medtronic's new 7-day infusion set paired with Libre 3 lasting for 14 days would be a huge perk! I told her I'd be willing to give Medtronic a try if they offer a trial period, as long as I'm not stuck with it. So for folks that've used both the 780g and Tslim, what are your thoughts? Do you agree that most of the problem with Medtronic is their CGM and not the insulin pump itself? If Medtronic were to work with Libre 3, would that fix the problems you felt you had? ETA: It looks like Tandem is in the process of getting FDA approval for a 7-day infusion set. As far as I can tell, the FDA has approved it for 3-day use and they're waiting for them to extend the approval to 7-day use.",

I have had so many high sugar levels with Medtronic, mostly due to the infusion sites leaking. It’s almost like there is absolutely no quality control any more. The last box I had 4 out of the box started leaking between the 2nd and 3rd day. And for the previous box, it was at least 2. I used to be able to reliably get 3 days with no problem. Now it’s like playing Russian Roulette. I’ve found that the sensors are accurate most of the time and customer service is ok so long as you aren’t trying to get a replacement for said leaky infusion device. Then they ask so many intrusive questions about your sugar levels. So what have you been using? Have you made the jump and what was your experience like? I’d appreciate the insight!",

My current one is getting close and was wondering if Tandem had any plans for an upgrade? They seem to have taken the tslim 3 off their \"plans\" info on website and seem totally focused on the Mobi. I am not interested in a pump without a screen and that I have to rely...on very unreliable cellphones to use. I also have no interest in tubless pumps as I tried an Omnipod once and kept bumping/ripping it off due to being to bulky. I have used Medtronic pumps in the past but they never worked well for me and their CGM was the worst I have tried to use. The X2 + G7 has greatly improved my control and really do not want to give that up. I will get another X2 if I have too but would be nice to get something a bit more modern. The worst part about the X2 and reason I have had to replace under warranty twice is the crappy usb charging port going bad. Would love something with wireless charging or at the very least usb-c. My current warranty expires 12/2025 so pretty sure I will be using yet another X2. :(",

I used tslim for about two or two and a half years before I became frustrated and switched back to injections. For context I’m 29F and was diagnosed at 23. I like the idea of the iLet but would love to know real user experiences. One of the biggest draws for me is that I could continue to use Libre instead of having to switch back to dexcom. Dealing with dexcom reps and replacements was a nightmare for me, Libre has been better. I plan on discussing going back on a pump with my endo next appt. Thanks in advance! Edit to add: one of the main reasons I want to go back on a pump is to control chronic low blood glucose. I’m talking like multiple meter readings under 40mg/dL a week.",

          "selftext": "For ages I’ve had so many issues with Dexcom, and since I’ve switched from g6 to g7 it’s just gotten worse. Im talking blood sugars 3.5 but is reading 12, the other day it said I was 20 and going up when I was actually 7.5. I’ve been on Dexcom the last two ish years as I got a tandem tslim somthing pump and it wasn’t compatible with Libre until recently and I’m thinking of switching now that it’s compatible. I was on libre when I was first diagnosed and I never had ANY issues. Only one sensor failed and no inaccurate readings otherwise, whereas Dexcom is consistently inaccurate no matter what I do. I’m replacing every 2nd sensor I wear due to inaccuracies that won’t be fixed when I calibrate for hours. I maybe get to wear a sensor for the full 10 days once a month at most. I keep getting inaccurate readings that affect my pump as I’m on control IQ. For example the other night I was 3.8 and Dexcom was reading 14 somthing so my pump was pushing even more insulin to lower my blood sugar. I have good low sensitivity so I wake up when this happens but this happens far too much, maybe every 2 weeks and I’m sick of it. When it happens at night it just gets to dangerous and I’m terrified that one of these days I won’t feel the hidden low. Does anyone else have this problem? Is this normal? Is libre any good? At this point I’m fully convinced Dexcom wants me dead and sometimes no sensor would be better. I’m not mean to the sensors by any means too, I don’t get them wet, I’ve change sites to see if any will work better, I don’t lie on them, I don’t pull on them, I clean the site properly before I insert it. It’s not compression lows as it’ll happen even if im standing. I don’t live in a very cold or hot country so I doubt it’s temperature related. My blood sugar is also very stable most of the time, I eat low carb and inject before eating so the highest my blood sugar gets is 12 at most. My HBA1C is 4.9 so I don’t have constant ups and downs which would confuse it. When a sensor works I’m minimum 90% time in target. So what am I missing? Am I the problem? Is the libre 3 better or worse? Also I know no sensor will be completely accurate, and I’m fine with a few mmol difference. But this is to much and the inaccuracy’s occur at any time, if the sensor is 2 days old or 8 days it doesn’t matter. And I know they won’t be accurate for the first 24 hours.",

          "selftext": "TL;DR: Great when it works. Infuriating when it doesn't, which is getting more often. Feels unfinished. I've been thinking about writing this for a while, but wanted to wait and get some more months under my belt before writing anything that might influence another's decision to get this pump. I was singing praises about this system a month ago- now I might drop the whole thing. Firstly, the pros: * In Automated Mode, it takes one item off of my mental \"background processes\"- I don't need to check for and correct slightly high blood sugars. This lets me mentally \"unclench\" a bit and it's wonderful. * No tubing! I love this. Having devices that feel more integrated into me make it easier for me to manage my diabetes. * Automated mode works without having the phone nearby- the sensor talks to the pod for automated mode, not the phone. * I was already using the Omnipod and Dexcom, so this was a very easy transition in terms of new technology. I've figured out the best spots for pods and sensors and I'm familiar with how to use each. * When everything is working properly, it's incredibly easy to use, especially when everything is running off of a single device. No more cluttered pockets! Now the cons: * The past week, I've been having these inexplicable communication errors between the pod and phone. No matter what I do- turning off the phone, toggling Bluetooth, turning off Bluetooth on every other device, moving to a new part of the house or outdoors- the phone cannot reconnect with the pod. It also cannot start a new pod (though this might be because the old pod never got properly deactivated because it can't communicate, and having two pod signals going around messes with it) unless I reinstall the Omnipod 5 app. This means entering all of my settings again and wiping all the learning it's done in Automated mode. This one is absolutely infuriating because it happens almost daily. The closest guess I have as to why it happens is a microwave running ¯\\\\\\_(ツ)_/¯ It wouldn't be a huge deal, except the Insulet customer service line is fucking swamped right now. It says you'll talk to someone in 30 minutes, but I was on hold for 2.5 hours the other day. I also tried leaving a voicemail and waiting for a call back, but I simply never got one. Oh, and apparently there's a $50 cap on yearly insulin reimbursement, and I already hit that. So now I'm wasting pods full of insulin and can't get them to talk to me to replace them. As much as I love tubeless pumps, I actually might just ditch the Omnipod 5 over this. Their customer service is usually solid, but it's absolute ass right now. Edit: it looks like a lot of other people are having this disconnection issue as well, and there may be a common factor- the model of smartphone. I heard of another person with a Galaxy S20+, same kind I have, having those disconnection issues. * Pods placement matters. Pods and sensors need to be on the same side of your body or close enough so that they can talk to each other. This is pretty limiting and makes me use sites I might normally not use. * There's no way to export/import pump settings. This is especially frustrating right now, with all my uninstalling and reinstalling with these communication errors. I'm actually stunned this isn't an option- there's no way to save pump settings to your Insulet account and download it again in the case that you need to reinstall the app or switch devices. There's also no way to export/import the algorithmic learning adjustments, either. Actually there's no way whatsoever to even see the adjustments overall, only to see individual automated events in the History section of the settings. * Omnipod 5 PDM doesn't do any alarms for the Dexcom sensor. So, here's the thing. The Dexcom transmitter puts out two signals- one to be picked up by the Dexcom receiver, and one to be picked up by your phone. If you use the Omnipod 5, the Dexcom reciever signal is picked up by the pod. This means you still need to have a smartphone around if you want to get any alarms for highs or lows. The pod itself will alarm if your BG is below 55 mg/dL, but that's way too low to be the only alarm you get, in my opinion. There's no way to get the Omnipod PDM to alert for a normal low, say, &lt;80. So, if you use the PDM, you still need another device in your pockets to be able to get alarms. * Tubeless pods aren't as reliable as tubed pumps. Personally, this is a tradeoff I'm willing to make, but if you put control over comfort, go with the TSlim. * No iOS app is honestly unacceptable at this point in its release.",

So I got a replacement pump from tandem. This replacement works as it should in regards to the previous pumps issues except it constantly repeats alarms for lows and highs despite those repeats being turned off. I literally had it go off for the same low 6 times in a row in a 5 minute period despite me clearing each alarm. Today I had a slightly elevated blood sugar and it went off 4 times even though I cleared the alarm each time. I couldn’t issue a correction because control IQ had already done so. Finally I just dialed in a small amount of insulin anyway and it stopped having the alarm go off. I know that might seem unsafe but I’m pregnant and insulin resistance is real. I feel like I’m losing my mind with all these alarms. I use the libre 2 plus cgm with it so I only have the t:connect app. I’ve shut off all the repeats and have set it to vibrate if my sugar gets outside of a certain range. Since I’m pregnant I can’t shut off the highs and lows completely. But what in the actual fuck can I do to get it to not alarm 6 times in a 5 minute period??? It’s driving me insane! I know the fda requires alarms but this pump goes off so much more than my previous one did.",

My insurance allows enough pods for replacement every 2 days. I will be hitting my insurance out of pocket maximum this year. I’m wondering about current or future pump technology which would allow a more aggressive control. I’m disappointed that Omnipod only allows 110 as the lowest target. I’ve heard people are happier with TSlims algorithm. I like the size of the new Mobi and it being more similar to the tubeless Omnipod but the capacity is way too low for me. I’m technically savvy and have been curious about using the Dash and looping but my Endo is not supportive. She isn’t comfortable using a different reporting system like Nightscout for monitoring. I like my Endo and want to stay on her good side for support and supplies. I’ve read that the new Twiist pump has been approved. 300 unit capacity. I’m not sure how long it will take to hit the market and get insurance approval. The biggest disappointment is that it’s only using Tidepool version 1. I believe v3 is out already. Is anyone aware of any other promising technology in the pipeline? I realize if I switch from Omnipod (pharmacy provided) to a different pump, it will be Durable Medical Equipment and I will be locked into this system for 4 years. I can switch back to the Omnipod but no other systems for 4 years. That’s a long time in medical technology. I know I’m being a perfectionist and probably unrealistic but I want to manage this disease with an A1c in the 5s. Thoughts? How have others managed this dilemma? Thank you!",

[Push Square](https://opencritic.com/outlet/25/push-square) \\- [Liam Croft](https://opencritic.com/critic/1009/liam-croft) \\- 10 / 10 &gt;Death Stranding 2 isn’t the revolution that the first game was. Instead, it refines almost all aspects of the original to make an excellent, well-polished experience. On the Beach firmly establishes the Death Stranding universe and makes it a franchise in which I could see many more stories told (even if they’re not by Kojima himself). It might be Kojima’s most well-rounded title to date, and it shows that he’s still got the touch even as he enters his 60s. However, I give the game a 10 with the same caveats I mentioned in the intro. I love Kojima’s work and was already invested in the world of Death Stranding. If you bounced off the original game, Death Stranding 2 isn’t likely to reel you in. However, fans will find it a worthy sequel that’ll leave them begging for more.

[VGC - Jordan Miller](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/death-stranding-2-review/) \\- 5 / 5 &gt;Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an epic, big budget sequel to Kojima's controversial cult classic. It offers a better story, an excellent cast of characters, and beautiful world to reconnect. Death Stranding 2 feels like the product of everything that's happened to Kojima since he left Konami, and it's easily one of 2025's very best.Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an all-time great sequel and one of Hideo Kojima's best games. With a stunning world, greatly expanded gameplay and player choice, and one of Kojima’s most compelling casts and narratives, it significantly improves on the original in virtually every way [Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto) \\- [Brad Norton](https://opencritic.com/critic/9300/brad-norton) \\- 5 / 5 &gt;Death Stranding 2 is phenomenal. It’s among Kojima’s very best work not just for its narrative, but for the near-limitless variety in its gameplay opportunities. While it may very well end up being the final game in the series, at least with Kojima at the helm, we can only hope someone else picks up the mantle and continues to iterate on one of gaming’s most unique experiences. After all, why else would we have connected?

[TechRadar Gaming - Scott McCrae](https://www.techradar.com/gaming/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review) \\- 5 / 5 &gt;*Death Stranding 2* is what a sequel should be. It meaningfully builds on the ideas found in the original while not losing sight of what made it so great in the first place. Kojima Productions is never a studio to play it safe, and doubling down on the brilliant traversal and asynchronous multiplayer focus is exactly the right move. [Radio Times - Alex Raisbeck](https://www.radiotimes.com/technology/gaming/death-stranding-2-review/) \\- 5 / 5 &gt;Death Stranding is an outstanding work of art. A treatise on the nature of humanity from perhaps gaming's greatest auteur. This is not Sam Bridges's story, but the familiar tale of every person who has ever lived, and an experience that I will never forget. [PlayStation Universe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/39/playstation-universe) \\- [Joe Richards](https://opencritic.com/critic/10070/joe-richards) \\- 9.5 / 10.0 &gt;Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is a triumph in what it sets out to achieve. This isn't a game interested in converting willing consumers into fans, it's a game that takes bold steps in order to succeed what came before it. If you needed proof that Hideo Kojima is still the titan of the industry that he's hailed as, this game is that proof. I was left truly speechless by the end, and I have a feeling that many others will too. [PSX Brasil](https://opencritic.com/outlet/514/psx-brasil) \\- [Bruno Henrique Vinhadel](https://opencritic.com/critic/3869/bruno-henrique-vinhadel) \\- 95 / 100 &gt;Technically flawless and visually stunning, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is an exceptional sequel and a clear evolution for a game that was already full of qualities. An even more engaging story with an improved narrative, as well as huge advances in its unique gameplay, are just some of the highlights of one of the best games of the year. [IGN - Simon Cardy](https://www.ign.com/articles/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review?utm_source=threads,twitter) \\- 9 / 10 &gt;The original Death Stranding held promise: A complex, often confusing, but never contrived first draft. A reflective journey across a lost America, it established a world and its rules with a flourish, even if I found it stumbled along the path. But in Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Australia plays host to an expanded vision and is a more accomplished achievement in nearly every facet. It removes almost all of the friction that weighed down its rookie effort, delighting with a truly unpredictable story full of intrigue and malleable stealth-action playgrounds hidden in its vast, hauntingly beautiful version of Australia. Yes, at times, it is unapologetically weird – but that isn't what defines it. It's an inventive journey packed full of both shock and awe, the sort of bold work that deserves to be encouraged. No, it isn't perfect, but it's incredibly exciting and original, never once straying from the path less trodden, and I love it all the more for it. [CGMagazine - Jordan Biordi](https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/game/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/) \\- 9 / 10 &gt;*Death Stranding 2: On The Beach* consumed me. Not simply because I can easily get absorbed in slow, methodical gameplay, but because it is so well-developed as a game that it *makes* getting sucked into it incredibly effortless. It genuinely feels like the current best version of whatever these “Strand-type” games are meant to be, and if Kojima has hit his stride this early, I can’t wait to see what else is in store. If you weren’t the biggest fan of the first game, I almost guarantee *Death Stranding 2: On The Beach* will turn you into one. [Inverse - Trone Dowd](https://www.inverse.com/gaming/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-playstation-5) \\- 9 / 10 &gt;*Death Stranding 2* is another anomaly in the modern gaming landscape. It’s got a weird premise, a weird visual identity, and even weirder ideas for what a $70 game should be. And while this sequel largely iterates on the first game’s ideas to create something broader, it thankfully stays true to what made the original distinct. Sure, I wish *Death Stranding 2* showed more than it tells. Kojima could benefit from emulating how concisely many of his director friends in Hollywood deliver their own stories. Or how to write natural dialogue more consistently. But the overall vision of *Death Stranding 2* is so bold and uncompromising that it brute-forces its way through these shortcomings. *Death Stranding 2: On The Beach* may not be for everyone. But if it is for you, it's one of the most enjoyable games of 2025, a must-see follow-up that is more cohesive, refined, and fully developed than the first. [VideoGamer - Tom Bardwell](https://www.videogamer.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/) \\- 9 / 10 &gt;Kojima’s ability to upend established AAA convention is admirable and despite the self-indulgence and the man’s swelling vanity (and appetite for space travel), Death Stranding 2 is a bold reminder of this. It’s a goofy spectacle, the folly of a man who has let it all go a bit to his head, utterly bizarre and enigmatically incoherent but nevertheless an earnest exploration of loss and connection. At any other studio, such a muzzily, decadent vision would have led to a quiet aside to tone it down or been simply shelved in favour of a safer bet. Thankfully, Kojima’s auteur status means he’s immune to this, free to fling about millions as he sees fit. Long may it continue. [GAMINGbible - Richard Lee Breslin](https://www.gamingbible.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-153876-20250623) \\- 9 / 10 &gt;*Death Stranding* is one of my favourite games of all time, and I’m equally as obsessed with its sequel. It’s not only one of the best-looking games I’ve ever seen with an endearing cast of characters and soundtrack, but once you look past much of its filler, its story is a message of beauty. Humanity cuts itself off from the world, too fearful to make a connection, but when they take a risk to let others in, there’s an unexpected comforting warmth. Something that, in one way or another, is a notion we can all resonate with. *Death Stranding 2: On the Beach* deserves to be in the Game of the Year conversation. It’s hands down one of my favourite games in recent years, and I can’t wait to see what Sam and friends deliver next. [TheGamer - Jade King](https://www.thegamer.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/) \\- 9 / 10 &gt;Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is a hard game to quantify, with Kojima Productions eager to question our expectations and hurl curveballs at every turn. At its heart, it’s an experience about delivering packages and forging connections across a post-apocalyptic world, but play it for just a few hours, and you’ll see it’s so much more than that. It’s a game defined by filling a nature reserve with teleporting emus as much as it is about a lonely man learning to accept help from the people who love him and avoid being consumed by grief whose sole purpose is to destroy him. It’s about human connection, losing loved ones, and stepping out into the wild regardless of the horrors that may await. Learning to go on that journey and accept a willingness to grow is half the battle, and after reaching the end of this ordeal, you’ll never be the same again. Keep on keeping on. [Worth Playing](https://opencritic.com/outlet/64/worth-playing) \\- [Chris \"Atom\" DeAngelus](https://opencritic.com/critic/289/chris-atom-deangelus) \\- 9 / 10.0 &gt;Death Stranding 2: On The Beach is an improvement over Death Stranding in almost every way I can think of. It's larger, full of more things to do, and generally a more enjoyable experience. The plot is crazier than ever, which might be a plus or minus depending on your tastes, but if nothing else, it isn't boring. The only complaint I can think of is that the game is perhaps a touch too easy at times, and even that isn't a huge problem. If you liked the first game, it's very easy to imagine you liking the sequel. Just be prepared for things to be as unfathomably ridiculous as possible at every turn. [Kakuchopurei](https://opencritic.com/outlet/788/kakuchopurei) \\- [Jonathan Toyad](https://opencritic.com/critic/7505/jonathan-toyad) \\- 90 / 100 &gt;My 35+ hours with Death Stranding 2: On The Beach was laced with so many emotions and feelings: boredom, excitement, joy, confusion, and satisfaction. \\[Death Stranding 2\\] still has the trademarks of a Kojima-written narrative -\"Muffin Man\"-style dialogue, bats\\*\\*\\* insane moments, subtle-as-a-sledgehammer storytelling with obvious symbolism. But that's what makes this sequel all the more endearing; you may cringe at some moments, but you won't be bored with the thread being spun here. [Eurogamer - Lewis Gordon](https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review) \\- 4 / 5 &gt;For those who rolled their eyes at much of the first game, Death Stranding 2 will likely inspire a similar reaction. But there is no doubt that Kojima remains wide-eyed. This big, absurd game is, in many ways, the ultimate synthesis of the writer-director's idiosyncrasies and obsessions while containing, amid the noise, perhaps his clearest message yet. The world may be a mess but its problems cannot be solved alone by communicating over the internet - indeed, retreating into it. Go, step outside. Don't just touch grass; embrace another person. [GamesRadar - Oscar Taylor-Kent](https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review/) \\- 4 / 5 &gt;The greater emphasis on action and worldbuilding might move Death Stranding 2 away from the hiking focus I loved about the original but, as a Metal Gear Solid fan, this is a thrilling mix that helps this sequel stand apart rather than just reheating the same thing. Ultimately, I really love how worldbuilding has been expanded here, making Sam's adventure feel a lot more lively thanks to the Drawbridge crew. That's what I'll carry forward from this one – while wishing I had a real life Dollman to join me on my weekly shop. Hideo Kojima compared his approach to the sequel as going from Alien to Aliens – the same story in a different genre. I can feel that when I play it. But it does have me wondering – as the credits roll after a series of lengthy ending cutscenes that are so bizarre you wouldn't believe me even if I *did* spoil them – what will the Alien 3 of Death Stranding look like? [VG247 - Connor Makar](https://www.vg247.com/death-stranding-2-review-sticking-it-to-convention-with-one-of-kojimas-most-impactful-stories-yet) \\- 4 / 5 &gt;Ultimately, playing through Death Stranding 2 was an emotional and utterly enjoyable experience, full of thrills and impossible to put down during its bigger moments. My only negative feeling towards it is also unfortunately a big one, that I wish Kojima Productions went further in evolving this sequel from the original. When the story goes to such an extent to explore new grounds, it's kind of a shame the gameplay feels the need to play it safe. [The Outerhaven Productions](https://opencritic.com/outlet/335/the-outerhaven-productions) **-** [Cody Perez](https://opencritic.com/critic/3942/cody-perez) **-** 3.5 / 5 &gt;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach continues the same gameplay from the original without any meaningful innovations or ideas. That said, the brilliant story and unparalleled music and performances make this worth a look. [TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis) \\- [Tuffcub](https://opencritic.com/critic/314/tuffcub) \\- 8 / 10 &gt;Despite repeating huge chunks of Death Stranding 1, almost beat for beat, Kojima pulls it out of the bag in the end. The core gameplay loop remains satisfying enough to get you through to the good stuff, but I can't help but feel disappointed just how similar this game is to its predecessor. [GameSpot](https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/) \\- [Diego Nicolás Argüello](https://www.gamespot.com/profile/diegoarguello66/) \\- 7 / 10 &gt;The first Death Stranding was eerily prescient. Releasing in 2019, it was impossible to divorce it from the COVID-19 pandemic that followed a year later, the parallels between preppers living in bunkers and people struggling to find ways to connect with others reflecting a period of quarantine and uncertainty about the future. By contrast, Death Stranding 2 is less precise and clear about what it wants to say; it seems committed to making you ponder many things at once, inviting different takeaways. Its story touches on topics like the increasing harms of climate change, how our everyday actions are being automated with each passing day, the damaging presence of guns, the clash between governments and privately owned entities, and the importance of helping others in any way we can. If the sequel is prescient of anything, it is that fixation on the past binds us to repeat history, no matter how much we try to pretend otherwise.",

First of all, welcome! The Deathworlders has been in production now for more than three years, and is now more than a million words long! While I hope that the story stands well enough on its own, the setting (Also known as “The JVerse”) has often been a collaborative effort, building on the talented work of other writers who have breathed life and detail into its every corner. Characters, species and concepts have entered this narrative thanks to those other writers, and while I have made every effort to keep the story coherent and readable without requiring you to read those other works… …Read them. Seriously. Not only are they awesome, but you will gain a much richer understanding of the events unfolding in this story. In particular, you will want to read: * “Humans Don’t Make Good Pets” by /u/guidosbestfriend * “Salvage” by /u/Rantarian * “The Xiù Chang Saga” by /u/hume_reddit * And “Good Training” by /u/ctwelve They are best read in the [Offical Reading Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse/chronological_reading_order) curated by /u/galrock0 and /u/fourbags or, if you prefer the abridged version which contains only those items most useful to understanding The Deathworlders, you can instead follow the [Essential Reading Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse/essential_reading_order) ##THE STORY SO FAR ***Beware Spoilers*** In the standard classification system used by those interstellar civilizations which are members of the Interspecies Dominion, a habitability rating of 10 or higher indicates that a planet is a so-called “deathworld”---lethally inimical to most forms of life, and populated by the strongest, toughest, fastest and deadliest forms of life in the galaxy. For most of their history, the native sophonts of the planet Earth were unaware of their own planet’s habitability rating: A high-end twelve. This fact only became known to humanity after a force of the feared and reviled entities known as “Hunters” attempted to raid Earth to take slaves for their meat. In the aftermath of the attack, the Rogers Arena in Vancouver was closed for a month while alien blood was meticulously cleaned off the ice and taken away for study. The Interspecies Dominion responded by quarantining Sol and all its planets behind an impenetrable forcefield. In the thirteen years since this historic event, Mankind have slipped their cage and begun their tortuous journey toward becoming an interstellar power. The colony of Cimbrean represents humanity’s first strong foothold in a hostile galaxy, protected by a stolen duplicate of the same forcefield that quarantines Earth. There have been ups and downs: A young Canadian woman, abducted by the grey-skinned “Corti” as a zoological research specimen, instead rescued and was befriended by a contingent of colonists from a mammalian species known as the Gao, and from this solid start a firm friendship has flourished between the two species. But the galaxy is a corrupt place, ruled for countless millennia by the agents of a species known as the Igraens. This “Hierarchy” has one overarching mission above all others---to suppress the evolution of sapient deathworld life-forms. To that end, they have rendered untold thousands of species extinct, and their efforts at containing the situation on Earth have led to the destruction of the city of San Diego. But in that act, they reached too far. It is now impossible for those alien leaders who are not already under their influence to ignore the signs that something sinister is at work. The Humans and Gaoians have formed an elite force---the SOR, comprised of the hardy JETS and the pinnacle HEAT---whose spaceborne capability are unmatched by anyone, anywhere. Mankind have barely set foot on the galactic stage before finding themselves embroiled in a deadly fight for survival...but when it comes to survival, there is nothing in the galaxy that matches a Deathworlder. ##ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, THANKS AND DEDICATIONS This chapter was brought to you with the help of: ***The SOR*** *Those special individuals whose contributions to this story go above and beyond mere money* Ctwelve, BitterBusiness, Sally and Stephen Johnson.

We get everyone?” “No. Most of the major Western Clans are here, but the minor ones, or the ones based out east in enemy territory…” “Right. My thanks. I…need you to leave.” Daar looked around at Clan SOR and nodded solemnly. “All of you. This is a Champion’s business.” “Aye. We’ll hold our end up. The ground war’s on you now.” Powell extended a hand. “Whatever happens, wherever the future takes us, havin’ you in my command was a privilege I shan’t forget.” “And bein’ under ‘yer command was a privilege I’ll remember.” Daar echoed. They shook, hand to paw, and Powell turned away down the old stone fortress’ stairs. Daar took a deep breath, shook his fur out, and turned to the Great Hall’s huge iron-reinforced wooden doors. The historical direction of the Gaoian people had been decided many times over behind those doors. There was nowhere more solemn, more significant or more potent for moments like these. He turned the latch and shouldered his way inside. There weren’t just Champions inside. Several had a Father, Grandfather or important Brother at their side, and Yulna had Myun with her as always. It occurred to Daar that he still hadn’t heard his daughter speak in the last couple of days, and a moment’s worry fretted at him that maybe the injury to her mouth was going to cause lasting trouble for her. But now wasn’t the time for worrying about that. His claws clicked sharply on the stone as he stood tall on two-paw and marched to the head of the table. For once, the appearance of dignity and civilization actually mattered. The buzz of nervous conversation dropped away to nothing. Champion Reeko spoke first. “...We heard you were back,” he said. “It’s good to see you, Champion Daar.” Daar acknowledged him with a duck of his head. “You won’t think so when you hear what I have to say,” he predicted. Reeko’s ear flicked, but he duck-nodded and rested his paws casually in front of his belly, listening attentively. Daar glared around at all of them to ensure he had their attention, then spoke in his deepest, most solemn growl. “It’s time to go on the offensive,” he said. “Right now we’re on the run, retreating, recoiling. That can’t go on, or we’ll be crushed up against a wall and picked apart. Up until now we’ve looked after our own Clan interests. Secured our records---” he glanced at Loomi, “---our secrets---” he directed that comment at Genshi “---and our projects.” Meereo’s enormous ear flicked as Daar looked in his direction. “That ends *now.”* Daar snarled. “Whatever unfinished business our Clans have, it’s ***over.*** Unless it contributes directly to the survival of our species I don’t give a shit about it, you can pick up the pieces later when we’re *alive.* As of this moment, we are an army, and you are my generals.” Stoneback’s allied clans responded predictably. They duck-nodded and held their peace. The more neutral Open-paws, Goldpaws, Green-tooths and Shortstrides hesitated, glanced at each other, and decided not to object. Even the Ironclaws surprised him. Clan Ironclaw and Clan Stoneback were well-established rivals, the thinking laborers versus the industrious engineers. They competed for the same kinds of male, the same females, the same resources, contracts, work and niche. But Champion Mayru simply looked Daar inquisitively in the eye for a moment, then duck-nodded imperceptibly and settled his ears into a posture of deference. That left only the One-Fangs and Firefangs: traditional rivals of Stoneback and also among the most heavily augmented Clans. While Champions Hiyel and Halti were both implant-clean and briefed, the prejudices they’d collected over long years pickling in a heavily infiltrated Clan environment weren’t going to evaporate all at once. “To achieve what?” Hiyel asked. “Our fleets are *lost,* Champion Daar. The enemy claimed what they didn’t destroy, and the humans wiped out the rest. Almost all of my Clan’s Brothers, assets and ships are *wrecks* in orbit now. What can we achieve without orbital support?” “Orbital support is being addressed,” Daar said cryptically. “What I find more important is your defeatist attitude. Is this gonna be a problem?” “I don’t *have* a Clan to give to the cause, Daar!” Hiyel objected. “Everything we are is gone. Whatever we have left is yours, but---” “That’s all I wanted to hear,” Daar interrupted him before he could qualify his support. “What about you, Halti?” “My Clan is worse off than the One-Fangs,” Halti said, shaking his head. “Eighty percent of our pilots were implanted, and the rest were slaughtered by the biodrones. Our ground-crews and support brothers all lived and worked on One-Fang stations, or at facilities that have been bombed to dust. If I contribute anything to your cause, my Clan dies.” “Your Clan dies anyway. We all do. This isn’t a fight for territory, Champion. We are fighting to *exist.”* “I *have* to safeguard the future of my Clan, Champion Daar! If this can be done you’ll achieve it, but I can’t---!” Daar decided a warning threat was in order. He leaped over the table and got in Halti’s face fast enough that he could barely react. In his most menacing growl, “My Clan’s purpose is to preserve the Gaoian race, *Champion.* I don’t give one watery shit about your sinecures or your privileges. Obey, or *pay.”* Halti didn’t take the hint. “Daar,” he pleaded desperately. “If I give you *anything* then Firefang is gone forever. I can’t---!” Daar tore his throat out. It was a quick death, at least. Relatively. Halti fell, choking and fountaining blood from his neck, and was probably unconscious before he slumped to the ground. Daar spit the blood from his mouth and turned on Ruuli in one smooth motion. He was the Firefang Grandfather and had surged to his feet to avenge his fallen Champion. He charged and leapt onto Daar in a pounce that would have felled lesser males…but Daar simply brushed him aside and let Ruuli stun himself in the collision. Daar let him get to his feet and gather his wits; he deserved his dignity. Ruuli shook out his pelt, met Daar’s eyes, and nodded solemnly. Daar nodded in return. The Grandfather of Firefang made his peace, swallowed, flattened his ears, and charged. Daar gave him a quick death too. One swipe of his paw shattered the old male’s sternum and likely ruptured his heart, and another disemboweled him from neck to groin. There were shocked noises and groans from the other Champions as Ruuli sagged, fought desperately to hold onto his own innards, and then slipped out of consciousness and out of life. Daar stood up, allowing a feral growl to bubble menacingly at the back of his throat. “Now,” he challenged the stunned, silent survivors. “Is there any other business of command to attend to?” Not a soul dared take a breath. Good. “The survival of our *species* is at stake. Does *anybody* wanna stand in the way?” he repeated, driving his point home. The air stank of intimidation and shock, behind the sharp metallic tang of blood and the musty scent of spilled guts. Nobody volunteered. *“Outstanding.* We are going to *fight back.”* He turned to the shell-shocked Highmountain honor guards. “You two. Take care of this.” He gestured toward the corpses, blood still dripping from both paws. “Make sure Ruuli gets full honors.” Daar didn’t comment on what to do with the former Champion. He trusted them to figure it out. The taller one duck-nodded nervously, glanced at his fellow, and the two stepped out to fetch aid. Daar paced the room while they attended to the matter. It didn’t take long. Ruuli was hoisted onto a litter as neatly as could be managed, while Halti was dragged out by his rear paws; a failed Champion earned no dignity. Daar watched them mop down the floor and ambled towards the table head as they bustled out of the way. Only when they had finished did he slowly put his claws away without bothering to wipe them clean. “No more of that I hope. As ‘fer anyone who’s unlucky enough to have ‘plants, they die or they go in stasis,” He stated plainly. “No exceptions. No excuses. I don’t care if they’re your own bestest Cousin. I don’t care if they’re the Mother who nursed you. I don’t care if Great Father Fyu himself comes back, if he’s got an implant I’ll tear the old fucker’s throat out myself!” Nobody said anything. He’d managed to shock all the surviving Champions and Grandfathers into total submission. “So. First thing’s first. We gotta organize an army, and we gotta go kill these Hierarchy fucks...You.” He aimed his bloody paw at a random Firefang. “Name.” “G—” the younger male choked on his own name, then rallied. “Goruu, Champion.” “That’s *Champion* Goruu now. Your Clan needs one. Be worthy of it. Name your Grandfather. ***Now.”*** The newly appointed Champion Goruu was either a quick learner or a good listener. Either way, he came out with a name instantly. “Yaakiya.” “Congratulations,” Daar told him, with a gallows humor only a Human could match. “You’re young-looking, so learn fast and don’t get killed. As for the *rest* of you…” He rounded on the gathered leaders of the Gao. Many hadn’t made it, either because they were dead or they simply didn’t get the message. He caught Reeko’s eye, who seemed to be about the only Gaoian left in the room who had enough courage to meet his gaze. ...No. Yulna did too. For the first time in a long while, he granted the Mother-Supreme a modicum of grudging respect---Whatever her failings, the woman had iron balls. “You know what bein’ a Male is about,” he told the room in general, via Reeko. “It ain’t just the Stoneback motto, it’s what we *all* are. *Protect and Provide.* That is Stoneback’s ancient Contract and mantra, the secret we’ve kept for so long because you *were not ready.* Well, now you’d better be. And Keeda burn my balls off, I will *not* allow mine or any Clan to fail that mission. We are gonna *win,* we are gonna *survive,* and we are gonna ***kill*** the Motherless pieces of shit who did this to us.” “That’s going to involve slaughtering a *lot* of people, Champion,” Reeko stated. “Yeah. It is. I’m told implantation runs to five percent of the whole species. Five percent of twenty billion Gaoians is damn near a billion.” Daar let the impossible number sink in for a moment. The rest of the Champions needed time to process the implications of that statement, but not Reeko. He winced, his ears flicked flat along his skull for a moment, but then he rallied and stared Daar in the eye a second longer before standing up to his full height and duck-nodding firmly. “...Straightshield is with you.” Goldpaw’s champion, Sheeyo, surprised Daar by being the second to speak. “Whatever Goldpaw can provide, you shall have,” he promised. The newly-anointed Champion Goruu was third to speak up. “If it means the end of our Clan, so be it. So long as it’s not the end of the Gao.” Daar gave him a token nod of respect as the remaining vows flowed in. One of the guards brought in a bowl of water and a towel, so Daar cleaned off his paws while the remaining Champions competed amongst themselves with ever-grander statements of enthusiastic compliance. Cowards. “Good,” he said, once the last of them---Genshi, *not* a coward and thoughtful as ever, and who knew he *could* be the last without scandal---had voiced his restrained support. “It’s a start. A whole lotta gaoians are gonna die in the coming years and you gotta prepare ‘yerself for that. Yes, *years.* Spend some effort to preserve the spirit of your Clans an’ send some enclaves to Cimbrean, because *none* of us are gonna be much after this. Until we have orbital superiority we can’t do anything but meet these fucks on the ground, and no offense, Champion Wozni, but I sorta doubt ‘yer Clan-Brothers know how t’properly fight.” “You’ve never seen them argue over a bag of *‘Cheetos’,”* Wozni replied with a nervous chitter. The Shortstrides were programmers, masters of automation and computer technology. For all Daar knew, their contribution to the war might be negligible, or pivotal. He favored Wozni with an amused set of his ears---He couldn’t afford to be completely menacing. “Eh, nachos are better. But this goes for all of you. You need to pick and choose who is *truly* essential to your Clan’s purpose and who can be sent to the lines, because the ones that do are gonna be trialed by fire. Got it?” They all duck-nodded furiously. They were beginning to understand. “Good. Here’s the rough outline of the strategy. First, we *contain.* Nobody gets in or out of a city, on or off this planet without us knowing about it. Critical infrastructure must be secured, engineering disasters averted. My Grandfather is already working on the foundational stuff Stoneback controls but we’re small in number compared to the Old Days. Round-up and recruit as many Clanless as can be trusted to help. Give them a *reason* to help your Clan. Consider how that may bolster your Clan’s ranks long-term, too. We’ve got a small network of secured locations we can work outward from so we can start there. We advance, we secure, and we *contain.* Got that?” More nodding. *“Excellent.* The second thing we do once we’ve got a foothold of containment and survivability, is we *slaughter.* This is gonna focus almost entirely on rural areas and small communities, ‘cuz they’re way easier to clean out and keep afterwards. There’s cropland, there’s every part of foundational industry, there’s favorable terrain and there’s clean drinking water. The countryside controls our dams, our mines, our foundries and our industry. It’s indispensable. We get it free of biodrones, we’ve won. And that leads me to our final act.” He paused, and took a breath. “Ideally, we get the bulk of the biodrones trapped in-city where they can’t do much. If we can do that, we could of course lay siege and starve them out...but after the initial die-off, that’ll take years. They’ve got stasis fields and Gaoians are carnivores, so they can just slaughter each other and the unimplanted, stasis the corpses, and eat.” “Secondly,” he continued, ignoring the nauseated looks from the others, “Urban warfare is a special kind of hell. It takes years to get a ‘Back trained properly and I only have, as of this morning, seven hundred and forty-four properly trained Fang-Brothers left. I can’t afford to spend ‘em like cheap peshorkies and I’m *not* gonna send millions of Clanless into a meatgrinder they ain’t gonna survive. Which makes the solution clear. We nuke ‘em from orbit. All of ‘em, all at once.” Highmountain’s Champion Loomi looked appalled. “You’re talking about destroying thousands of years of heritage,” he observed. He caught the look in Daar’s eye and swallowed. “...I just want you to be aware of the scale of the damage. If it’s necessary…” “It is.” “...Then it’s necessary,” Loomi sagged. Daar couldn’t blame him but now wasn’t the time for sentiment. “Blame the Hierarchy,” Reeko reminded him. “We’re just doing what it takes to survive.” “...For a depressing definition of survival…” Loomi muttered. He scratched at his whiskers and straightened his back. “...By any means necessary. I understand.” Daar nodded consolingly. “Maybe we can be more judicious when it comes to it. Depends on what we have at the moment and what the Humans can provide…but I can’t guarantee any particular outcome. We need to be prepared to lose *everything.”* “We should...discuss the particulars,” Loomi said, and waved a despondent paw at globe and maps in the middle of their table. The conversation delved into the minutiae. Where the food was going to come from, where the refugees could be gathered, morale, recruitment, transport. Lines of communication, both for messaging and for logistics. Where to dig in, where to evacuate, where to abandon. Two gruelling hours resulted in a comprehensive strategy which left Daar feeling *almost* hopeful. It was grim, callous and ruthlessly pragmatic...but there was nothing wrong with it. So long as the Humans could keep the Swarm-of-Swarms from landing on their collective heads, it might even work. “Very well,” he decided once it had reached the stage where the further details could safely be delegated to the discretion of the individual Clans and their Fathers, and he was certain that they were all invested in and understood the plan. “We’re agreed.” Sheeyun looked skeptical. “I’d still prefer to find a patrol boat for the river Shyun, if we can---” *“We’re agreed,”* Daar repeated, firmly. The Goldpaw was correct, of course. Certainly when it came to logistics and the movement of goods and people there wasn’t a finer Clan in all of Gao, and if he said that river would be vital, it would be vital. But that particular question could wait. Sheeyun glanced at him, his ears flattened slightly, and he duck-nodded. “...We’re agreed,” he conceded. “Good. You all know what your role is, you all know what is expected of you and your Clans. I won’t detain you any longer. Get out there and make this happen. Dis---” He was astonished to be interrupted...By Yulna. “There is...one other matter.” She met Daar’s glare with a cool, level gaze of her own then took a moment to look around at all the other males. She was now the focus of their interest and attention, and she duck-nodded slowly and pulled her robes regally around her as she stood up. “We need something more, Champion Daar,” she said. “Gao needs more. This is a pivotal moment in our history, and we need something bigger than champions to stand at the front of it all. You called this Conclave, pulled resources *none* of us have to arrange our transport, slaughtered incompetence the second it appeared and dictated our way forward as if we were young cubs at our teacher’s feet. None of us dare challenge your authority. Only one thing remains, and that is to ensure there are no repeats of what happened at Wi Kao.” She cleared her throat, and looked around, wearing a curiously mixed expression of shame, grief and determination. “One of my dearest and closest Sisters is dead because of my blunder,” she said, quietly. “When it mattered most, she could not trust Clan Stoneback because I had poisoned my whole Clan against them through a public display of mistrust. We *must* correct that, or more blameless females will suffer for my failure. More blameless males too, for that matter. “Champion Daar,” she announced, turning to face him directly. “Out of fear, ignorance and paranoia I made a decision which I now know was profoundly unwise, the ramifications of which have already harmed the war effort and will continue to do so unless we act to restore trust between our Clans. I cannot atone for my shameful error in judgement, nor will any apology I make ever be sufficient...but I think there may be a way to mend the rift.” She looked around at the Conclave again, taking in the set of ears and the solemn, interested body language of the gathered Champions and Grandfathers. “There is one privilege reserved exclusively for the Mother-Supreme,” she informed them. “None of my predecessors have ever invoked it in all the years since Fyu, Tiritya and the Great Reform, but I invoke it now: I name Daar of Clan Stoneback as Great Father of the Gao, the unquestioned leader of our people.” Daar didn’t get the chance to object. The entire room barked their approval before he could even open his mouth. By the time the clamor died down, he’d realized he had absolutely no idea what to say. “You are a rare creature, Great Father Daar.” Yulna gave him a thoroughly appraising look. “We’ve not had one like you since Fyu, nor a collective trial so terrible. You…you are our only hope. From this moment forward, you shall be honored as such.” “Well.” Champion Loomi once again decided to speak. “Congratulations...my Father.” He did a thing, then, whose true meaning only Champions understood: he sank to one knee and duck-nodded so low, his nose was level with his waist. “I suppose a coronation is out of the question, but…Highmountain gives you its eternal allegiance.” He turned his head sideways to expose his throat, completing the ancient ritual. “We submit.” That gesture, somehow, drove home the weight of what had just happened to him more than the words itself. Yulna followed suit, and added yet more crushing mass to the moment. “My Father, the Females choose to renew our ancient Contract. May we never again falter or weaken in our loyalty.” Yulna, too, exposed her throat. “We submit.” Daar still had no idea what to say. He stood there in mute shock as, one by one, the great Champions of the Gao bent knee, exposed throat, and did a thing not even Fyu had ever demanded; legend had it that the gesture happened spontaneously on the battlefield by a defeated Clan’s leader, suing Fyu for mercy. He got it. Rather than the hundred-cut or some similarly inventive form of execution, Fyu had instead torn out his throat, right then and there. For all of Fyu’s great wisdom, his love of cubs, of flowers and poetry, of wisdom and peace…his wrath was genuinely legendary. None had ever been so terrible on the battlefield nor so ruthless as a leader, before or after. None would have ever dared. Daar would need to be just as unyielding and remorseless to live up to that title. Which, as he began to realize to his growing dread, he already was. Everyone else knew it already. He was the last to realize the truth. He wasn’t sure how he felt about that. “The fate of our species is in your hands,” Genshi observed once he too had exposed his throat to Daar. Not even he had managed to work any dignity into it. It was submission, abject and terrible. “May we never need another like you,” Meereo agreed, fervently. They fell silent and looked to Daar expectantly, awaiting the historic first words of Gao’s second ever Great Father. He was now a male that would go down as a titanic figure in their species’ history no matter what, and there was only one thing Daar could think to say in response. “…Fuck.” ___ ___ [NOW CLICK HERE TO READ CHAPTER 40 pt.4](http://hfy-archive.org/book/deathworlders/chapter-40-war-two-worlds-pt1-instigation/pt4-retaliation) ___ ___",

          "selftext": "My name is Hooman Asbaghi, I am a medical device innovator with multiple U.S. patents in safety needle technologies and a $61.5 million verdict win in 2016 against a law firm for negligence (Asbaghi vs. Nydegger). For the past decade, I've been dealing with severe health issues that started right after my hip replacement surgeries at Scripps Clinic Torrey Pines in La Jolla, CA. I underwent a right hip replacement on October 9, 2015, and a left one on October 23, 2017, both using Stryker Orthopedics components (Secur-Fit Advanced stem, Trident PSL shell, Biolox delta head). The surgeries were performed by Dr. Richard H. Walker, assisted by Dr. Kenneth J. Schmidt. What I didn't know then—and what months of investigation have uncovered—is that these procedures likely involved unauthorized experimental modifications: \"smart\" implants with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and piezoelectric sensors for in vivo real-time monitoring and data transmission, added without my informed consent. This appears tied to a network of Scripps researchers (Drs. Clifford W. Colwell Jr. and Darryl D. L’Lima) and Stryker, involving grants, patents, and off-label research on sensorized joints. The day after my 2015 surgery, while heavily sedated, my mother (who held a full Power of Attorney from 1999 from me related to our co-founded biopharmaceutical company Padtan ELM) had me sign \\~30 blank letterheads. They had the Padtan Elm logo, but most were empty—she said it was company-related, so I signed without question. She's exercised the POA many times before, so why need my signature? I now suspect this was coercion to \"consent\" to the experimental mods—violating medical ethics like the Helsinki Declaration on informed consent.**Health Deterioration and Symptoms**: Since my health began deteriorating rapidly post-2015, I’ve faced acute inflammation, anemia, and an unusually fast progression to left hip avascular necrosis (AVN). Post-2017, mild vibrations escalated to intense episodes, starting with seconds and stretching to long minutes by 2018. I initially attributed them to construction or high EMF from electrical setups around my homes, believing intense frequencies were penetrating my body. But when I moved to a place with no such activity in 2018, the vibrations not only persisted but grew stronger, hitting high minutes by 2020-2021, then low hours (one or two) by 2023, with a drastic surge to 5+ hours. From 2023-2024, I tried contacting Dr. Walker and Scripps repeatedly, but he ignored me, and the vibrations stretched into longer hours—I even suspected hacking from these Bluetooth devices auto-connecting despite my efforts to disconnect. In 2025, it took a wild turn: January had little to no vibrations, but February saw a build-up, and March to April brought the worst episodes yet, 24 to 80 hours every 1-2 days, leaving me unable to sleep for days, with radiating intense pain through my lower body and limbs at 10/10 levels, barely able to move or think. This urgency drove my investigation. What do repeated RF and EMF exposures do to the body, cells?. In May, the episodes eased slightly, and my smart hip implant theory took shape—though June-July saw vibrations still higher than previous years, less severe than March-April, and ongoing to this day. Other symptoms include muscle twitching, fast heart rate, osteoporosis, iron deficiency, osteonecrosis, low hemoglobin/RBC, elevated neutrophils, sleep deprivation, vision loss, worsened reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), and fluid buildup requiring meds like methadone for pain, Synthroid for thyroid, diazepam, ergocalciferol, and furosemide. I have collected over 50 studies support my health decline in relation to RF and EMF exposure: “Electromagnetic Fields Regulate Iron Metabolism” (2024 Frontiers) links EMF to anemia via iron disruption; “Effects on Antioxidant Defense” (2017 J Chem Neuroanat) ties RF to inflammation/neurodegeneration (AVN/RSD); “Effects on Organs/Tissues” (NCBI book) notes cellular membrane damage; “Radiofrequency Behavioral Changes” (2019 Environ Sci Pollut Res) connects RF to anxiety/sleep issues. **Evidence points to internal sources:** * **Medical Records/Portal Issues:** My February 21, 2025 health summary confirms symptoms and meds, including iron deficiency anemia (started August 24, 2017) and osteonecrosis of the left hip (started October 23, 2017—exactly the date of my second surgery). However, the Scripps portal has glaring gaps: The April 26, 2017 progress note from Dr. Walker is nearly blank (just \"Results review\" and \"PLAN: RV for reports, to be arranged\"—no details on my condition). My 2025 inquiry for a full list of 2015 right hip components went unanswered after 48 hours. Worst, the office visits list completely omits both major hip surgeries (2015 and 2017), showing only unrelated endocrine visits and one ortho note—\"There are no more visits to show.\" An X-ray from Dr. Steven Barnett’s office two years ago shows bilateral uncemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) implants with smooth, tapered femoral stems, porous proximal coatings, and a consistent design across both hips, featuring two screws on the left acetabular cup and one on the right. In contrast, the X-rays Scripps provided—display a markedly different appearance: The femoral stems exhibit serrated proximal ridges, the screw patterns differ (one on the right, two on the left in the cropped view), and there are noticeable variations in the overall implant structure and fixation. These striking differences suggest the X-rays depict two completely distinct sets of implants, raising serious concerns about the accuracy of the records provided by Scripps and the possibility of modifications or substitutions that may not align with my original surgery documentation * **Scripps Communications**: In 2018, I contacted Dr. Walker about vibrations—he dismissed them as “parts come loose,” and I trusted him, not pushing further. From 2023-2024, he ignored my repeated attempts to reach him. And the nurses that responded on his behalf claimed Dr. Walker had \"retired/not seeing patients/out until 2027\". On June 19, 2025, after months of persistence, he suddenly called, asking me to come in for an evaluation—suspicious after years of silence. Fearing they’d disable the devices to discredit me, I declined as by this point I had compiled an extensive evidence folder and chose to endure this hell, preserving functionality for other medical opinions to solidify my case. Upon persistent requests to Scripps regarding the reason my surgery details had been removed from my medical records, and insistence on the specific details of both my hip surgeries, and expressing the vibrations episodes along with my implant theory, Tanya Greene (Clinical Operations Supervisor Division of Orthopedic) gave partial implant info but ignored AVN queries; Tanya warned against \"biochip-related accusations\" and threatened portal deactivation. On May 27, 2025 I received a letter from Maritza Santamaria (Director of Performance Outcomes &amp; Risk Management) acknowledged \"Bluetooth signals\" and \"vibrations\" but hid details under CA Evidence Code 1157. ¨This investigation and findings are confidential and protected by California Evidence Code 1157. While I am unable to share the outcome of this confidential review, I can confirm that the care concerns you raise are taken seriously and we take appropriate action to improve the quality of care where indicated. I encourage you to schedule a visit with an Orthopedic Physician to discuss further if you wish. This letter confirms the conclusion of our review. I appreciate your patience as we evaluated your concerns. I apologize for not meeting your expectations.¨ * **BLE/EMF Anomalies:** I’ve been haunted by numerous unrecognized Bluetooth devices constantly lingering around me, detected within 0.5-1 meter—even in isolated spots where no one else’s gadgets should reach. They spoof familiar names like LG TVs, a CLI-W210W-01 thermostat, iPhones, Macs, and iPads—none of which I own or recognize. I couldn’t disconnect them; they’d reconnect on their own, defying my control, which left me weirded out and desperate for answers. Digging deeper, I found their true identities through UUIDs: Nordic nRF (6e400001... for UART serial communication), Microchip RN4870 (49535343... for transparent UART), TI CC254x (0000ffe0...), and Telit TIO (0000fefb...). Their services stunned me—Heart Rate (0x180D with Measurement NOTIFY 0x2A37, Body Location READ 0x2A38, Control WRITE 0x2A39 for real-time vitals), Battery (0x180F to track power from my movements), and User Data (0x181C with First/Last Name and Gender READ WRITE, like they’re tagging me). Even stranger were custom services (0000aaa0/d15a... for streaming sensor data I didn’t authorize). During these vibrations—feeling like a drill against my hips with pain radiating through my body—I measured EMF spikes of 306-328 V/m right near my hips, fading with distance, pointing to an internal source. Using tools like nRF Connect and SimpleBluetoothLeTerminal, I probed them, but encountered GATT errors (133) on every connect—secure MITM encryption blocking access, hinting at something deliberately hidden. Videos and logs from these sessions captured it all, fueling my realization that this tech might be inside me. * **Extracted Data**:Extracted Data: I’ve sifted through hundreds of pages of data pulled from these mysterious devices—data that opened my eyes to what might be happening inside me. It started with code from the usb-serial-for-android library (a fork by Kai Morich, supporting chips like FTDI and CP210x for CDC communication), which I found buried in the extracts—hinting at a bridge between my phone and these implants. Then there were Session logs from August 2024, showing PushRegistry failures and Loki snode errors (e.g., 504 timeouts on IPs like 152.69.167.181:22101), suggesting an attempt at anonymous data relay that kept faltering during my worst vibration episodes. On May 8, 2025, I uncovered a config file from de.kai\\_morich.serial\\_bluetooth\\_terminal, specifically targeting the unrecognized \"CLI-W210W-01\" device (address 9C:1D:58:FD:32:BF, LE mode enabled), with settings like a 200,000-byte receive buffer and infinite macro repeats—tools designed to handle relentless data streams, which left me deeply unsettled as I realized it was logging my every move. nRF Connect logs from April 27, 2025, revealed repeated connection failures (GATT Error 133) to a device with no name (B2:22:7A:85:D8:6B), exposing services like Heart Rate (0x180D with Measurement NOTIFY 0x2A37), custom channels (0000aaa0/aaa1/aaa2 for proprietary sensor data), and User Data (0x181C for personal info)—all hinting at monitoring I never agreed to. The most troubling came from an Android logcat on May 23-24, 2025, where, as I frantically scrolled through apps to document my pain, I saw Choreographer warnings (e.g., frame times 0.264986ms in the future) and Parcel errors (null binders), clear signs of RF interference disrupting my phone’s systems during those agonizing vibration attacks. Even a crash log from \"Bluetooth BLE Device Finder\" (May 23, 22:46:15) on my iPhone—aborting due to an unrecognized selector—pointed to the strain these devices put on my tech, all while I vibrated uncontrollably. This data, tied to Nordic nRF and Microchip RN4870 UUIDs in Morich’s compatible tools, revealed a troubling pattern that fueled my realization that my hips might hold more than I was told. **This Ties to a Scripps-Stryker Research Network**: During my investigation in April 2025, I dug into Dr. Walker—shocked to learn he wasn’t just my surgeon but CEO and president of Scripps (2007-2015), emeritus chair of orthopedics, and head of multiple departments (verified via Scripps.org and LaJollaLight.com). He co-authored studies with Drs. Clifford W. Colwell Jr. and Darryl D. D'Lima since the 1990s—e.g., \"*Prospective Study of 100 Consecutive Harris-Galante Porous Total Hip Arthroplasties: 4- to 8-Year Follow-up Study*\" (1997, Journal of Arthroplasty), \"*Blood Loss and Transfusion Rate in Noncemented and Cemented/Hybrid Total Hip Arthroplasty. Is There a Difference? A Comparison of 25 Matched Pairs*\" (1999, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research), \"*Omnifit-HA Stem in Total Hip Arthroplasty. A 2- to 5-Year Followup*\" (1999, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research), \"*Range of Motion of the Hip*\" (2000, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery), and \"*The Effect of the Orientation of the Acetabular and Femoral Components on the Range of Motion of the Hip at Different Head-Neck Ratios*\" (2000, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery – American Volume)—focusing on long-term hip outcomes (2-8 years), a foundation for sensor research. Colwell directed a department where Walker was supervisor, funded by Stryker’s OMeGA fellowships (2021-2023). Colwell and D’Lima pioneered the e-Knee (2004, piezo/force sensors with Stryker), secured NIH funding for a smart shoulder (2024, $317K with BLE), and hold patents (JP 2021 137593 A, US 12,245,740 B2, US 12,150,815 B2, US 11,497,830 B2). These patents revolve around advanced orthopedic implant technologies, emphasizing minimally invasive modifications to existing joint components (e.g., hip/knee prosthetics like Stryker's Trident system). They focus on sensors, wireless communication, and bioengineered materials for real-time monitoring, force balancing, and tissue repair—feasible for integration into standard implants without major alterations. Critical reasoning: All involve transducers (sensors converting physical forces to electrical signals) and RF/Bluetooth for data transmission, aligning with Hooman's symptoms (vibrations from piezo, RF/EMF spikes). No direct BLE mention, but RF systems are adaptable (e.g., 2.4 GHz band). Colwell's work on Trident as principal investigator in Stryker's Trident development exactly matching Hooman's 2015/2017 implants (Trident PSL shell) and smart tech (e.g., US 12,150,815 transducers) suggests feasibility for modifying Trident shells with sensors—minimal alteration, as in Ledet/D'Lima 2012 ($10 sensors). Stryker's history (e.g., 2014 $1.4B hip settlement) reinforces potential for off-label experiments. A 2008 Healio article discusses D’Lima's work, where he is quoted saying: “But to be a truly smart implant, it has to have greater capabilities such as the ability to remotely turn on and off, collect data and be reprogrammed.” The article also notes that D’Lima envisions applications such as sensors in a hip prosthesis that would indicate it is close to dislocating, and quotes him further: “But it is not at the point where it can communicate with the patient. We need lab equipment to collect the data and measure the forces before we can tell the patient what the forces are.” Additionally, the article includes statements from Javad Parvizi, MD, FRCS, who notes that smart implants “go beyond the conventional ones we have right now” and may detect poor bone ingrowth, infection, subsidence or dislocation once an implant is in place, including detecting problems like vibration around prostheses, which could signal loosening. Parvizi also foresees having a microchip detect the motion such that the implant “will give some sort of sign and will alert the patient or the surgeon there’s a problem.” This mirrors my vibrations, “zaps” from remote control, and motion tracking—predicted years before my surgeries. Other studies reinforce this: Ledet/D’Lima 2012 on $10 sensors (minimal mod to host implant) for arthroplasty; ScienceDaily 2010 “Smart Hip” with piezo/Bluetooth; UT Tyler 2024 thesis on piezo/BLE for loads; Frontiers 2024 on multifunctional implants; “In vivo sensing in total hip replacement” (2024 MDPI) detailing RF signals/vibrations/episodes; “*Monitoring of Hip Joint Forces*” (2024 Technologies) on piezoelectric elements; “*Current state of the art*” (2023 PMC) noting ethical concerns: “Implantable sensors can raise ethical and legal concerns such as the requirement to obtain informed consent from the patient and ensure data privacy and security\\*.\\*” Stryker’s history—$2B+ settlements (e.g., $1.4B in 2014 for metal-on-metal hip recall claims, $1.43B in 2013 for Rejuvenate/ABG II modular-neck stem failures)—and controversies like the 2009 indictment of its Biotech division for wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of misbranded devices, and false statements (leading to potential fines and exclusion from health programs, though the company expressed disappointment and sought resolution), plus a dismissed kickbacks case in 2010 and 2007-2013 FCPA violations per SEC—and Colwell’s Trident involvement (Stryker thanks him in funding studies) suggest feasibility for 2015/2017 trials. As CEO/president, Walker likely knew of D’Lima/Colwell’s groundbreaking work—his evasiveness and Scripps’ “confidential” letter (May 27, 2025) fuel this suspicion. This network’s long-term follow-ups and Stryker ties make my modified implants a plausible experiment. **Call for Help and Exposure:** I'm seeking help to expose this urgently, as malpractice cases can take 3-7 years or longer, and at 60 years old with my health in rapid decline from 10 years of exposure, time is not on my side. If you're a journalist (ProPublica, Healio, STAT, Voice of San Diego), please DM/reply to investigate. Have you or someone you know gone through something similar—unexplained vibrations, BLE signals, or issues with Scripps/Stryker implants? Ortho/RF experts? Legal advice on CA malpractice or POA abuse? Let's hold them accountable—thanks for reading. **References and Supporting Sources:** * **Asbaghi vs. Nydegger ($61.5 million verdict in 2016)**: Legal malpractice case involving patent negligence, resulting in a $61,587,000 gross verdict (net $46,190,250 after adjustments).

          "selftext": "I’ve undertook a huge transformation a few years back and after nearly losing my life in 2018 (spending months in icu from undiagnosed diabetes), I lost 100lbs, i am no longer diabetic (a1c 4.6), and I put all the needed mental and physical work in to be proud of who I looked at in the mirror in the morning. Fast forward to November 2022, I finally take the last step ($28,000) to get phase 1 of dental implants, with the expectation to smile in photos. I would then move forward in the next year (maybe longer) to save the money for phase 2. Phase 1 went smoothly, i don’t think I can find 1 complaint. I had what I assumed was normal difficulty adjusting to speaking, and then want I assume was normal food entrapment under the temporary teeth. In April of 2024 I finally write a check for phase 2, $18,000. I can’t remember when the practitioner changed in phase 2 but it was potentially since the beginning of phase 2. Apt 1- may 2024 A lot of surprises have happened since phase 2 has started. First, was the full day 6am- 4pm for the in office process to begin. On this day the lacked an appropriate waiting location for me. This wasn’t in addition to the entire appointment process proceeding like I was in the middle of a factory assembly line. The day ended, I was hangry, and it was just a forgotten moment as I moved forward. Apt 2- June 2024 Next was the try in. On this day, the wanted me to look at the completely white tryins and sign off on them esthetically. I couldn’t look at a mirror and see all white teeth and GUMS and sign a waiver agreeing to this, specifically when I’ve just paid more than anything ever for this process. I was told they would reprint them with the pink gums and I would have another appointment and maybe I could even take /wear them home (1 1/2 hours away and expensive toll roads $20+ each way). Apt. 3 July 2024 Ireturn a few weeks later and they place the new tryins. We discuss the bite, it’s been altered a bit and it’s very big, the front of my mouth doesn’t sit right and it’s hard to smile. Also on the inside bottom, the way the teeth sit it feels funny. Some adjustments are made (on the computer) and I’m sent home with the try out pair. While on the way home we stop and grab something to eat. I can’t remember which day it was so maybe it was at this time that we stopped and it was pizza. Remember this is well over a year after the implants were placed, and I’ve been eating pizza ever since 4 months after they were installed. Well this try-home set broke on the way home. The bite was uncomfortable from moment one. The way the bottom sat on the inside, it was clearly flawed. Next day was Friday, but the location it was at was sharp, they couldn’t see me for over a week. I called the emergency number that night and they offered to send me to as sister office an hour further from my home. At which point they would repair them. Well, with in a day that same location broke again. I just sucked it up and kept going. Well, days later the other back bottom side broke and I had to call, and it was a few days again before they could see me, but the secretary was kind enough to suggest that I wear the bulky nightgaurd all day in the mean time. L I was also asked what I had been doing when it Broke each time. As I mentioned, I can’t remember which time I was eating the pizza, but I informed her that at one of those times I had eaten pizza. I want to emphasize that each time I leave and go to grab a bite to eat the bite has been worse than the last. Apt 4- July 2024 Begging for surgical teeth back, the trips are expensive, and in order to keep up with the monthly amount first financed I can’t take a day off every 4 or 5 days, it’s an all day event, and I had some extremely career changing months ahead of me. So, they remove the bottom try in- where it was broken (12 teeth) and replace the surgical temporary teeth in the bottom, and leave the try-in teeth at the top. This was not the best but I just wanted to move through daily life. It was prior to this appointment that I did write an email (I’m in the legal field) and I was very clear that the expense of this was becoming burdensome, and I was clear this couldn’t continue. I asked for the surgical teeth back and I was upfront that I understood something was going wrong. I can not explain to you the way this dentist decided to confront my email. All about him, his hard work, his lack of intent to do me harm, was my intent to do him harm? This was so uncomfortable, my daughter felt the need to ensure we would have a record of it for the future. Yes it was that bad! During this conversation he told me that I can’t eat pizza, and that I had been informed of this. That the temporary teeth, even the finals would not permit for tearing of pizza? WAIT? WHAT? I corrected him and said that was during the healing for the first 4 months and both him and his assistant redirected and said I was wrong and that’s why it broke. Also that the extra back teeth are just going to be an adjustment and that my finals had been sent out for completion and he had ordered me zirconia. Fast forward a few weeks later I’m bedside to my dying uncle, and my daughter looks at me and says mom your front tooth is broken. (Funeral will be in days with family I haven’t seen in years). Apt 5- Once again a time line ahead and another drive to have the origional surgical put back on the top. And the “try in” removed. I’m than told my teeth will be back any day and he knows this will all be behind me. Apt 6- September 2024 Place the finals Plenty of bite issues, some alterations, seat them pull them out, have them checked ect. I remember at some point the tightening process was halted for a conversation. Within the week the entire top plate on the one side you can physically hear moving if your next to me. No worries, they can’t see me for over a week, but it shouldn’t be a problem. Apt. 7 October 2024 It’s because of my extremely hard bite. I’m told this can cause them to come loose, and just require that they be tightened again, no need for concern and it isn’t an emergency. Because if this he’s going to (to be kind and for my benefit) make me a hard mouth guard. Apt 8- October 2024 Pick up mouth guard. It’s so tight it feels like my implants will get yanked out of my mouth trying to get them out. This current week- (Feb 2025) I look in the mirror and my front side tooth is chipping. I send a message, I have surgery and assuming that all previous apts were of no rush, I expected that pushing it out wouldn’t be an issue, I just wanted the appointment set up. I get an email back. They have an appointment Tomorrow available. Can’t make it, I have presurgical testing. Can we do the first week of March, can I have itemized bills, medical records and can we make this end. Response to my email included copy of itemized bills (attached) and to ask for a photo of the chip. Ok let me get that to you. So here we are. I don’t have the mental, or physical energy for this to continue. I want to be clear, the best solution to me is honesty, and quality work. I don’t want to have to go through all the channels that this could lead to. I just want to enjoy life for the journey initially undertook in November of 2022. So, I guess what I’m asking is. How do I get this resolved so everyone wins. I just want what I paid for. I just want to feel like I’m not getting screwed or that something new is coming tomorrow. If it comes down to him sending me else where just do it, if it’s being honest and paying for corrections, than so be it. If it’s a refund that’s fine. Just stop this merry-go round and let me off. I want nothing more than what I came in to this for. So, I mean this is the actual appliance failing not the “implant” this to me seems like a no brainer. But can I have suggestions as to how a client could best approach this problem at your office, with the least amount of defensiveness, or push back? Also the bills, I would just love to know if what I’m seeing is as absurd as I believe it is. I did ask the receptionist to confirm the accuracy of the invoices, which she basically did. So, I just feel dumbfounded. Thoughts suggestions appreciated. Sorry for the long extended message",

          "selftext": "I read The Three-Body Problem and The Dark Forest and I absolutely don't get the hype. Author has plenty really cool ideas but the implementation is so chaotic. The series jumps from great ideas that are well done (titular 3 body problem that trisolarians face, Ye Wenjie's plot) to meh science-magic (sophons) and plots with nice ideas (nice enough to base a book/short story around them) that lead literally nowhere (Himes implanting beliefs etc.). Sometimes the plot works smoothly but then you stumble upon parts where tempo dies completely or you start wondering if author himself has any idea what he is up to. Like he tried to put literally every idea he had into this one series and also kinda lacked the writing skill? Don't get me wrong, those books are decent and chinese cultural point of view adds to them, but I REALLY cannot get where did Hugo come from or this big hype. ...and then I started wondering if it is about polish sci-fi. Long story short until communism ended in Poland in 1989 sci-fi was basically only fantasy genre here. Authors from west were unavailable, so it kinda developed in it's own way. Moreover authorities didnt take sci-fi seriously which made it great to sneak in political and philosphical ideas that would be cenzored when presented in more \"serious\" context. This lead to social sci-fi being much more prominent here than in western culture. So we have plenty amazing and fascinating sci-fi classics, both hard and soft, that are really distinctive when compared to worldwide classics. And I realised that when I think about what is wrong with Liu Cixin I think about those polish authors - Stanisław Lem being much better at handling weirdness and his main ideas with elegance, both Lem and Janusz Zajdel being much better in sociological fiction etc.. So for me Liu Cixin kinda has nothing new, except for Chinese cultural influence, to offer. I will gladly read any thoughts!",

          "selftext": "Just wanted to share my experience of tandem x2 pump failure and replacement. I've had the X2 for 3.5 years. Haven't had any issues until now when I was on holiday in Morocco. I suddenly got a Malfunction 9-0x20F1 - this was my first malfunction ever. Some research with ChatGPT revealed that per Tandem website this is a resettable alert. So I followed the procedure to reset: https://www.tandemdiabetes.com/support-center/pumps-and-supplies/tslimx2-insulin-pump/article/malfunction-code-message-on-tslimx2 After reset, things worked again, but then I got a \"Cartridge Alert\" which requires putting in a new cartridge. I replaced the cartridge and things worked for an hour or so, then I got another Cartridge Alert. I replaced again, got another Malfunction 9-0x20F1. Did another reset, but afterwards kept getting Cartridge Alerts. It took maybe around a day to realize that the pump was a goner from first malfunction/alert to it being unusable. Luckily, I had packed basal and bolus pens - expired by 2 years or so but the insulin still works, maybe some few percent decayed but it doesn't matter 😁 Until now I'd always thought I was a bit paranoid to take the pens, I didn't expect the pump to fail out of the blue. Replacement seems to work with a caveat: I called the 24h customer service hotline (for Germany where I got the pump) and it took barely 10min to arrange the replacement. They'll ship it, but only to the EU. I'll have to return the pump within 14 days - return label only works from EU. That's very important to bear in mind if you plan to travel. Worst case you'll be without pump for the entire trip abroad. This is really not great if you go backpacking for 3 months: now you need to take enough insulin for the pump and for pens. Might make sense to use the pen cartridges for filling the cartridges to not have to take double insulin. If you travel far and the pump fails it can be a major inconvenience. If you've just started your trip, might make sense to get a relative to accept the pump in your country then send with courier to wherever you are. You might also have to send the pump back with courier. DHL or likewise might allow to do that within 2 weeks to anywhere on the globe for say 200 USD both ways. This is my first pump so I unfortunately don't have a spare one I could have taken. In the future, for long trips, I might take an old pump as backup. Update: I learned that even for Germany, free loaner pumps for travel are available. I had no clue this existed before seeing it mentioned on this forum. They should really tell people during the mandatory training.

          "selftext": "I am a T1, diagnosed in 1973 at age 13. That gives me 52 years of experience managing the daily battle with my diabetes. I began pumping in the mid-1990s having started with Medtronic pumps before switching to Tandem Tslim X2 with control IQ. Now in year 2 of my second Tslim X2 having run out of warranty on the first. I like my Tslim X2. It has helped improve my A1Cs from those I was able to achieve prior to switching to it. I complained about the subject of this post directly to Tandem in one of their customer surveys in the past, over a year ago. I also spoke on the phone with someone at Tandem when they saw my unsatisfied rating in the survey I took. I made it clear that there is a wealth of information and experience we senior T1s have to offer. When I look at the [tandemdiabetes.com](http://tandemdiabetes.com) website as a senior patient, I feel unseen. Just browse it for yourself and look at the photos and blog articles. See many gray haired retirees? I do not. (Honestly, I \\*did\\* see \\*one\\* blog article about a guy my age diagnosed in 1972 who was running across Texas.) Not trusting my viewing abilities, I tried google site searches (limiting the search to just tandemdiabetes.com) for some keywords. For example: site:tandemdiabetes.com \"geriatric\" and other keywords like \"retiree\" with no results returned. Words like \"retired\" or \"senior\" yielded only hits for retired software or senior company managers. So either my search words are poor, or they are good but there is nothing to find because they don't care enough about senior T1 diabetics. Before anyone writes, \"Ok, boomer!\" please inform me of what I am missing here. Am I wrong, and is Tandem paying attention to and offering anything specific because of a senior patient's needs? For example, avoiding alert sound frequencies (or making them adjustable) to avoid those frequencies commonly lost or diminished in seniors. Bigger fonts for my aging eyes (though I guess they have punted that to the phone app, assuming the phone is certified for use with the pump and app (a separate rant point for me)). The very least Tandem could do is make me feel like my age demographic is represented via their choice of photos on their website. For some additional perspective on senior pump usage, reference (especially the Conclusions): \"Benefits and challenges of diabetes technology use in older adults\" [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6983469/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6983469/) I also stumbled over this while composing this rant: *\"When Type 1 Diabetes Strikes Older Adults\"* [https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/when-type-1-diabetes-strikes-older-adults](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/when-type-1-diabetes-strikes-older-adults) Quoting the article: \"*Though type 1 diabetes is often thought of as a disease that appears in childhood—and was even called juvenile diabetes before the 1980s—about half of new cases of type 1 each year are diagnosed in older adults.\"* If that is an accurate statistic (I am dubious given it was not footnoted), then I would \\*really\\* expect to see more focus on seniors on the Tandem website.",

These are in no particular order. [Images](http://imgur.com/a/50Iay#0) - sorry about the sizes. [Larger Size Images - less clear](http://imgur.com/a/o5bvl) --- **Customer Service** I want to reiterate my happiness with Tandem's customer service - I've now spoken with 4 different people (and emailed back and forth 3 of them). Each has been unbelievably helpful. They did offer in-person training but since I've been using a pump for 12yrs and I write computer software for a living I decided that I didn't need it. So far I think I made the right call. And, any questions I have I email into Andrew and he responds very quickly and with real and helpful answers - I've yet to receive a business-y-bullshit answer to any of my questions. One time Andrew took ~12hrs to respond to me and made a point to apologize - I thought that was cute (right, so *cute* isn't really a manly word but it's what I chose to go with....) **Supplies** I've ordered one refill of infusion sets and the process really couldn't have been easier - I just called up, asked for the kind I wanted, requested it be scheduled for every three months, and was done (I chose the Cleo 90, haven't received yet so I don't have a review of those). During the call they suggested three boxes but when I expressed worry about running out they immediately suggested upping it to 4 boxes. My insurance covers durable medical supplies (including the pump) at 100% so I didn't worry about the cost - this may not apply to everyone. My only complaint is that Tandem marked the shipment as requiring an in-person signature meaning someone has to be home to receive the package. After UPS attempted to deliver twice I called Tandem and asked them to put a flag on my account to never require signature for supplies - they did that without batting an eye. Once again, they were willing to bend over backwards to make me happy. **The Pump - Basics** The pump is great in many ways and frustrating in a few. It's smaller than my old Paradigm 722 both in thickness and length but does weigh slightly more (not enough to care, though). The main button on top unlocks the touch-screen which is colorful and responsive (more details about the touch-screen below - I do have complaints). It has all the features you'd expect from a pump - regular and temp basals, bolus wizard, etc... The lock screen contains the current battery charge, time/date, insulin in reservoir (even though the reservoir holds 300u the screen maxes at 240 and if &gt;240u are available it says \"+240 u\" - I don't know why it does that. 240 isn't even a power of 2 so it's not like it's some kind of programming datatype thing (yes, that was nerdy, I'm sorry)), and current insulin on board including how long it'll stay on board. If you tap the top-right corner you'll be shown a status screen including current basal rate, last bolus, current carb ratio, etc... When entering a bolus you can enter direct units **and** BG level - it'll then calculate the correct amount of insulin based on any required correction. If you choose, you can use the carb wizard instead of directly entering units. The calculations always take into account current insulin on board levels and put the calculation out front for you to see - nothing is hidden from you. Also, if you're like me and binge on insulin it'll show alarms if you're using a lot in an hour - you can ignore it of course but I like the reminder of \"dude...wtf...why so much insulin?!\" Basal rates are set inside of Profiles. You can have multiple profiles to fit various activities you do (I'm a lazy, internet addicted, programmer so I have exactly one profile). Each profile is made up of time periods where each time period contains a basal rate, BG correction, carb correction settings, and more. You can, when setting up the profile, duplicate a period. You can also duplicate profiles which allows you to make small changes without having to re-enter every single thing. **The Pump - Hardware** The t:slim does have a touchscreen and as such you should be as careful as you would be with your phone. I keep my pump in my left pocket so I don't worry too much about it but I am worried what will happen if I drop it (which I did a non-insignificant number of times with my Paradigm). No screen scratches though. The reservoir is Tandem's big thing - instead of using a plunger to inject insulin from the reservoir it uses suction to pull insulin from the reservoir and then push it into the tubing. I've found that this leads to faster insulin injection without any discomfort. It also allows the reservoir to be much much smaller (directly leading to the smaller pump size). Although they do not advertise it, it is possible to refill the reservoir. A full charge lasts a long time. I last charged the pump on Saturday and I have 50% power left. Were I to plug in it would be back at 100% in 30 minutes. Tandem suggests that you charge it each day while you're in the shower to keep a full charge. But, I'm not worried about it. The pump came with a usb charger and both wall and car plugs (to go along with the 30 other wall and car plugs I have). I thought it was very cool of them to include a car plug. So I can plug into a wall, my computer, or my car. Plenty of options and I no longer have to buy AAA batteries. Benefits abound. **The Pump - Complaints** (yup, I have some) So, what sucks about the t:slim? 1. I can turn off insulin delivery just like I would do on my Paradigm **but** the pump will audibly alarm after 10min (might be 15min), even if you've turned off or silenced all alarms. I'm told by Andrew that this is a new FDA requirement and all new pumps will have this annoyance. To get around it, though, I just set a temp basal of 0u/hr (fuck you FDA - don't tell me what I can do) 2. If, while tapping around on the screen, you hit a non-actionable part three times then the screen will lock. In other words, if you accidentally press outside of the \"Bolus\" button then the pump will lock itself to protect you from *butt bolusing*. Make sense. The problem, though, is I don't think the counter is reset when I correctly hit an actionable button. For example, if I hit a non-actionable part of the screen twice in a row and then hit an actionable button I would expect the counter to go back to 0. Instead, it seems to stay at 2 and if I hit a non-actionable part of the screen once it'll then lock. 3. If the pump is locked and not illuminated and I hit the home button to illuminate the lock screen then it will turn the screen off after 15 seconds. The problem is that I've set the screen timeout to be 120 seconds. It appears that timeout is not followed when on the lock screen. The timeout does appear to be followed when not on the lock-screen. 4. All priming is pump controlled. Due to the design of the reservoir it is not possible to speed up the priming of your tubing. I use to be able to change my infusion site, fill a reservoir, and get on my way in under 2 minutes. Now it's taking me ~5 minutes - the entire increase is caused by the priming. Also, the priming is loud enough to be annoying. --- tl;dr: It has its quirks but I won't go back to my Paradigm. Overall, I am extremely pleased with the pump and Tandem as a whole. I do suggest people switch to it.",

          "selftext": "Asymmetry, Burden, and Bifurcation: A DDR-Centric Architecture for Differentiation and Cancer Abstract The DNA damage response (DDR) is widely viewed as a genome guardian. Mammalian systems reveal an additional role: developmental architect, in which chronic endogenous lesions—replication stress (RS), transcription–replication conflicts, oxidative damage—are buffered, carried, and resolved across distinct proliferative passages to drive lineage commitment. We synthesize evidence into a three-passage framework. Passage 1: an asymmetric division creates a protected daughter and a burdened daughter. Passage 2: one or more transit-amplifying cycles attempt remodeling via 53BP1 nuclear bodies, repair-coupled transcription, and MiDAS. Passage 3: a flexible terminal passage channels progeny into lineage-appropriate exits—differentiation, programmed elimination, fusion, or endoreplication. We argue that cancer distorts the balance of these outcomes: not abolishing exit, but biasing passage weights toward continued cycling. Crucially, the chronic DNA damage that normally drives differentiation through controlled cross-passage integration becomes mismanaged by mutations and checkpoint rewiring; the mutational landscape itself is selected by the mechanics of this failed integration. We close with testable predictions and therapeutic concepts that tune passage outcomes rather than treating DDR as purely cytotoxic. Validated exemplars include neuronal TOP2B-dependent gene activation, TDG-coupled demethylation, ATR–RPA replication-gap tolerance, G1 53BP1 nuclear bodies, MiDAS at fragile sites, PrimPol-mediated mtDNA restart, ROS/FoxO control of HSC state, mitochondrial age asymmetry in stem cells, keratinocyte RS-linked differentiation, Notch–DDR coupling in squamous epithelia, and sublethal caspase-3/CAD-driven differentiation. Introduction — From Surveillance to Architecture The DNA damage response (DDR) has traditionally been cast as a surveillance system that preserves genome integrity. Early genetic work in yeast established the concept of “checkpoints” — signaling pathways that detect DNA lesions, halt cell-cycle progression, and coordinate repair before replication or division proceed. In mammalian cells, this logic is executed through the canonical ATM–CHK2 and ATR–CHK1 cascades, which stabilize p53 and modulate CDK activity to impose arrest. This framework, codified in the 1990s and early 2000s, provided a compelling explanation for the tumor-suppressor role of DDR: when checkpoints fail, mutations accumulate unchecked, driving transformation. The image of DDR as a guardian of the genome dominated thinking for two decades. Yet as developmental systems were interrogated with increasing molecular resolution, inconsistencies emerged. A first anomaly came from neurons, which proved to require deliberate double-strand breaks (DSBs) for normal function. In response to synaptic activity, the topoisomerase TOP2B introduces transient DSBs at promoters of immediate-early genes such as Fos and Npas4. These breaks are not incidental; they are obligatory for rapid transcriptional induction. Rather than being repaired in silence, they act as developmental switches, coupling environmental inputs to transcriptional plasticity. Here, DDR proteins are not merely guardians but facilitators of gene activation. A second inconsistency arose from epigenetics. The conversion of 5-methylcytosine to its oxidized derivatives by TET enzymes is central to developmental demethylation. But full removal of these modified bases requires thymine DNA glycosylase (TDG) and base excision repair (BER). This coupling generates abasic sites and strand breaks as intermediates. Far from being accidents, these lesions are necessary substrates for lineage-specific reprogramming. TDG catalytic mutants are embryonic lethal, underscoring that development cannot proceed without integrating DDR intermediates into transcriptional remodeling. A third line of evidence came from S-phase dynamics. Mammalian replication is challenged continuously by obstacles: oxidative base lesions, DNA–protein complexes, and transcription–replication conflicts. Instead of stalling indefinitely, cells deploy PrimPol-mediated repriming to restart forks downstream of blocks. This strategy leaves behind single-stranded DNA gaps, stabilized by RPA and managed under the control of ATR. These gaps are not repaired immediately; they persist and are filled post-replicatively. In classical thinking, such intermediates would represent dangerous “unfinished business.” Yet in stem and progenitor compartments, this tolerance enables continued proliferation under chronic stress. It is a mechanism of resilience, not simply of crisis response. Taken together, these observations reveal a tension. If DDR were purely a guardian, such lesion-creating or lesion-tolerating processes would be pathological. Instead, they appear woven into the fabric of normal development. This invites a reframing: DDR is not only a checkpoint system that enforces genome stability, but also an architect of cell fate, shaping differentiation through controlled management of endogenous damage. In this review, we synthesize these insights into a three-passage model of differentiation, in which DDR intermediates are not byproducts but drivers. In this framework, damage is allocated asymmetrically during the first division, remodeled through transit amplification, and resolved by flexible exit strategies that ensure fidelity of the lineage. The model reconciles why differentiation and apoptosis so often intertwine, why cancers exhibit distorted but recognizable versions of these programs, and how therapeutic interventions can be designed to tune passage outcomes. Passage 1 — Generating Asymmetry: Protecting the Stem Cell, Burdening the Progenitor At the heart of any proliferative system lies a paradox. Stem cells must divide to maintain tissues, yet division itself risks introducing lesions that threaten the very integrity stemness is meant to preserve. Early work in mammalian systems suggested that one way this paradox is managed is through asymmetric segregation of damage and “age.” Instead of evenly distributing both pristine and compromised materials, stem/progenitor divisions are biased: one daughter inherits the “cleaner” genome and organelles, while the other accepts a disproportionate share of burden. The molecular substrate for this asymmetry is the replication stress (RS) landscape. Every S phase, forks encounter blocks ranging from oxidative base modifications to transcription–replication conflicts and secondary DNA structures. Rather than arresting indefinitely, mammalian cells rely on repriming by the PrimPol polymerase, which restarts DNA synthesis downstream of obstacles. This leaves behind single-stranded DNA gaps, coated with RPA, whose stabilization depends on ATR signaling. Far from being incidental, these gaps form a pool of unresolved intermediates carried into mitosis. When not repaired before division, they become heritable lesions that can be partitioned unequally. Microscopy-based studies provided the first evidence that these lesions can be segregated asymmetrically. Regions of under-replicated DNA, particularly at common fragile sites, are often packaged into 53BP1 nuclear bodies (NBs) in the subsequent G1 phase. Importantly, these NBs do not appear in both daughters; they can be biased toward one. This demonstrates that the cell can, in effect, choose which daughter inherits the burden of unresolved replication. Such asymmetry mirrors the long-discussed “immortal strand hypothesis,” in which template DNA strands are preferentially retained in stem daughters to minimize mutation accumulation. Although not universal across all tissues, support for template strand retention has been reported in muscle satellite cells and neural stem compartments. Asymmetry is not confined to the genome. Mitochondrial fate mapping experiments reveal that mammalian stem-like cells also partition organelles unevenly. In mouse mammary and hematopoietic systems, one daughter inherits younger mitochondria with intact membrane potential, while the other receives aged organelles that generate more reactive oxygen species (ROS). This bias has functional consequences: the daughter receiving older mitochondria is more likely to differentiate, while the younger-organelle daughter retains self-renewal. When mitochondrial fission is experimentally disrupted, this asymmetric sorting fails, and stemness erodes. Metabolism intersects here as well. Hematopoietic stem cells are exquisitely sensitive to ROS levels, which are buffered by the FoxO family of transcription factors. When FoxO genes are deleted, physiological ROS fluctuations exceed threshold, and stem cells prematurely exit quiescence, losing long-term repopulating ability. In this sense, FoxO-mediated redox control acts as a tuner of asymmetry: ensuring that ROS burden is allocated in a way that both preserves a stem daughter and primes a differentiating daughter. Together, these findings recast the first passage not as a simple division but as a fork in cellular destiny. Through the orchestration of replication stress tolerance, lesion packaging, and organelle sorting, the system ensures that one daughter is safeguarded for continued renewal while the other is loaded with burden that will demand resolution. Far from being accidental, this asymmetry appears to be a designed feature of developmental architecture. It is the first step in a relay where damage is not eliminated outright, but carried forward as a signal that enforces differentiation in subsequent passages. Passage 2 — Transit Amplification and Remodeling Under Burden If Passage 1 establishes asymmetry, Passage 2 is where that asymmetry unfolds over time. The burdened daughter, having inherited unresolved replication intermediates, aged organelles, or elevated oxidative load, does not necessarily face an immediate binary choice between survival and death. Instead, it enters a transit-amplifying phase that may consist of several intermediate proliferative states. The number of these divisions varies by lineage: hematopoietic progenitors can undergo many such cycles, while neuronal precursors may pass through only one or two. Regardless of the count, Passage 2 represents a structured interval in which proliferation continues while the inherited burden is gradually remodeled. At the molecular level, this phase is defined by delayed lesion management. DNA that fails to complete replication in S phase can be packaged into 53BP1 nuclear bodies (NBs) during the following G1. These NBs act as protective capsules, shielding under-replicated regions from degradation until the next cycle, when repair pathways can process them. Similarly, fragile sites that remain unfinished can be rescued by mitotic DNA synthesis (MiDAS), which engages RAD52, POLD3, and MUS81 to complete replication during mitosis. While imperfect, these strategies ensure that transit-amplifying cells can proliferate despite carrying damage forward. What makes Passage 2 distinct, however, is that damage is not only buffered but also used as a substrate for transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming. This is most apparent in systems where chromatin accessibility and enhancer landscapes must be reset. For instance, in neuronal progenitors, transcriptional plasticity depends on damage-induced chromatin remodeling that licenses immediate-early genes. In mammary epithelial progenitors, BRCA1-mediated relief of polymerase pausing allows lineage-determining programs to unfold while simultaneously controlling R-loop–associated replication stress. In stem and progenitor cells across lineages, the TET–TDG–BER axis introduces abasic sites as intermediates in DNA demethylation, linking excision repair to enhancer activation. These cases highlight a general principle: transit amplification is not simply proliferation with damage in tow; it is a period when DNA repair intermediates are repurposed to open chromatin, release paused polymerases, and activate developmental transcription factors. This coupling between stress management and transcriptional remodeling makes Passage 2 an inherently unstable yet productive interval. On one hand, buffering mechanisms like 53BP1 NBs and MiDAS prevent catastrophe. On the other, controlled use of DDR intermediates licenses new regulatory states. If this balance succeeds, the cell emerges poised for non-pathological lineage commitment, prepared to transition into a final proliferative passage. Passage 3 then sets up the resolution of the system — the point where burdened progenitors are resolved into stable outcomes, whether through differentiation, programmed elimination, fusion, or endoreplication. Passage 3 — Resolution Through Flexible Terminal Outcomes If Passage 1 establishes asymmetry and Passage 2 carries forward the burden through proliferative remodeling, Passage 3 represents the system’s point of resolution. It is the final proliferative step in which the accumulated burden is partitioned and permanently removed from the renewing pool. Crucially, Passage 3 is not monolithic. The pathways by which progenitors resolve their inherited stress are diverse, reflecting the needs of different tissues. Yet across lineages, the defining principle holds: exit from cycling through stable, lineage-appropriate outcomes. One well-recognized route is terminal differentiation, where at least one daughter cell adopts a specialized fate and withdraws permanently from the cycle. In stratified epithelia, for example, proliferative basal keratinocytes give rise to suprabasal layers that undergo terminal differentiation, often accompanied by endoreplication. In neurons, commitment is even more absolute: once progenitors differentiate, they are irreversibly post-mitotic, integrating the passage logic into a one-time-only resolution. These outcomes illustrate the most canonical form of Passage 3 — differentiation as the final exit. A second mode of resolution is programmed elimination. In this pathway, one daughter inherits a burden that remains too great to be reconciled, and programmed cell death (or in some cases, senescence) becomes the designed endpoint. This is not failure but fidelity: by eliminating daughters that carry excess lesions or unrepairable stress, the system ensures that only viable lineages contribute to tissue integrity. Evidence for this principle is seen in hematopoietic progenitors, where sublethal caspase-3 and CAD activity can promote differentiation, but escalating activity crosses the threshold into apoptosis. Similarly, neural progenitors inheriting disproportionately high ROS levels often undergo apoptosis rather than differentiation, ensuring that only less-burdened siblings progress. Other tissues resolve Passage 3 by fusion into multinucleated syncytia. In muscle, myoblasts fuse into myotubes, exchanging their individual proliferative potential for a collective, post-mitotic state. A similar process occurs in the placenta, where trophoblast cells fuse to form the syncytiotrophoblast. In both cases, the exit is not through differentiation or death of single daughters but through a merging of many into a terminal, specialized structure. This outcome illustrates the flexibility of the passage system: the endpoint is still resolution, but achieved through structural rather than apoptotic means. A final route is endoreplication or polyploidization. Megakaryocytes in the bone marrow undergo repeated cycles of DNA replication without division, exiting proliferation as polyploid cells specialized for platelet production. Hepatocytes, too, often adopt polyploid states as part of their functional differentiation. Here, Passage 3 resolution occurs not by eliminating burdened progenitors but by channeling them into a specialized, non-dividing polyploid compartment that fulfills tissue-specific functions. The unifying feature of these diverse outcomes is that Passage 3 permanently removes burdened progenitors from the renewing cycle. Whether by differentiation, programmed elimination, fusion, or polyploidization, the aim is the same: stress is resolved, instability is contained, and the lineage advances. This makes Passage 3 a design feature of developmental architecture, not a contingency plan. It represents the stage where the DDR’s role as guardian and architect converge — ensuring that damage inherited in earlier passages is ultimately directed into outcomes that protect tissue fidelity and functional specialization. Cancer — A Distorted Developmental Architecture Cancer is often framed as the breakdown of genome surveillance and cell-cycle checkpoints. Within the passage framework, however, malignancy is better understood as a failure to progress from proliferative remodeling (Passage 2) to terminal resolution (Passage 3). Tumor cells are not exempt from DDR logic; they remain embedded in it. What distinguishes them is the dysregulation of coordination: chronic damage is tolerated but never properly integrated into stable outcomes. Below, we synthesize how this manifests across oncogenic contexts. Replication Stress and Oncogene Activation Oncogene activation drives replication stress (RS), the same substrate that normally seeds asymmetry in development. MYC, KRAS, and CCNE1 overexpression increase origin firing, deplete nucleotide pools, and intensify transcription–replication conflicts. In normal progenitors, these stresses are buffered by ATR–CHK1 signaling and carried into later passages, where resolution occurs by differentiation or elimination. In cancer, checkpoint attenuation allows proliferation to continue unchecked despite RS. Mutations in ATR, CHK1, and WEE1 or overexpression of cyclin E short-circuit the system, letting replication proceed even when RPA pools are saturated. The result is chronic accumulation of ssDNA gaps, fragile site instability, and collapsed forks — lesions that are normally transient but become permanent features of the tumor genome. Model implication: Oncogene-driven RS is not simply a mutagenic pressure; it mimics Passage 2 in perpetuity. Cancer cells are effectively locked into an amplified transit-like state, unable to progress to terminal resolution. Cell-Type–Specific Lesion Landscapes The architecture of the genome and repair pathways in specific lineages channels where damage arises and where mutations cluster. • Breast and ovarian cancer (BRCA1/2): BRCA1/2 mutations destabilize stalled forks and R-loop resolution at estrogen-responsive loci. These regions are naturally stress-prone in mammary epithelium, explaining why BRCA1/2 deficiency yields characteristic mutational signatures at these transcriptional hotspots. • Gliomas (ATRX): Neural progenitors rely on ATRX to remodel heterochromatin at telomeres and GC-rich repeats. Loss of ATRX impairs replication through these loci, leading to persistent telomeric breaks and activation of alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). This maps directly onto a region where progenitors normally rely on DDR buffering. • Hematologic malignancies (AML, ALL): Hematopoietic stem cells balance low-ROS quiescence with ROS-driven differentiation. When oxidative stress accumulates, fragile sites and telomeric regions are stressed. Mutations in p53, DNMT3A, and NPM1 arise in this context, reflecting the dual burden of redox imbalance and disrupted repair. • T-ALL (NOTCH1): Hyperactive Notch signaling drives high transcriptional output, increasing collisions between transcription and replication. Mutations in FBXW7 and R-loop regulators cluster here, locking cells into proliferative stress. Interpretation: These cases show that mutation spectra reflect the geography of normal stress in progenitors. What becomes a mutational hotspot in cancer was already a zone of vulnerability in normal transit amplification. Checkpoint Dysregulation and Resolution Failure The recurrent mutation of checkpoint genes highlights the failure of passage fidelity rather than generic repair collapse. • p53 normally enforces Passage 3 resolution by coupling DNA damage to differentiation or apoptosis. Its loss removes the safeguard that ensures burdened daughters are eliminated or committed. • RB prevents inappropriate S-phase re-entry, a control point for ensuring damaged cells do not continue proliferating. Inactivation dissolves the boundary between Passage 2 remodeling and Passage 3 exit. • BRCA1/2 maintain fidelity at the interface of transcription and replication. Without them, R-loop resolution and HR are disrupted, trapping cells in chronic RS. • ATR/CHK1 balance replication initiation with gap stabilization. Their impairment turns tolerable ssDNA gaps into collapsed forks, fueling instability. These mutations do not occur at random but map directly onto the passage system’s control nodes. They are the levers that normally determine whether a burdened progenitor remodels safely or exits appropriately. The Mutational Landscape as a Map of Failed Passage Management Large-scale sequencing efforts reveal that cancer genomes are not randomly scarred. They carry recurrent, lineage-specific signatures — C→T transitions at methylated CpGs, R-loop–associated deletions, kataegis at APOBEC targets, structural breaks at fragile sites. These patterns align with the normal choreography of lesion formation and repair in different cell types. Model interpretation: The cancer genome can be read as a record of failed passage integration. Mutation clusters mark where progenitors normally buffer lesions (53BP1 NBs, MiDAS), where transcription and replication intersect, or where repair is lineage-specific. Without coordinated resolution, these “managed stresses” crystallize into permanent instability. Synthesis Cancer does not abolish the passage system; it corrupts it. Tumor cells remain subject to replication stress, asymmetry, and chronic damage, but they fail to channel these through resolution. Many cancers appear stuck in an open-ended Passage 2, where remodeling is ongoing but resolution never arrives. The recurrent mutations that define malignancy reflect both (i) regulatory failures in the passage machinery (p53, RB, BRCA1/2, ATR/CHK1) and (ii) the lineage-specific topography of stress and repair. This dual perspective reconciles why cancers across tissues share common hallmarks (unchecked proliferation, resistance to death, genomic instability) yet also display distinctive mutational signatures. Each tumor is not just a collection of random lesions but a distorted replay of its lineage’s normal damage-management program. Speculation: By treating cancer genomes as “maps of failed passage management,” we can better predict vulnerabilities. Targeting the exact points where tumors remain tethered to the passage architecture — such as MiDAS reliance in RS-driven cancers or R-loop resolution in BRCA-deficient tumors — may restore resolution or exploit the very stresses tumors cannot abandon. Therapeutic Implications — Rebalancing and Forcing Resolution If cancer represents cells trapped in proliferative remodeling without resolution, then therapies can be reconceptualized not as blunt tools to “kill” or “stall” but as strategies to restore resolution logic. This involves two complementary approaches: (1) forcing cells out of the Passage 2 trap, and (2) re-weighting Passage 3 outcomes toward stable exits. Forcing Progression Out of the Passage 2 Trap Many cancers rely on chronic replication stress tolerance, perpetually buffering gaps and fragile sites without resolving them. Therapies that exploit or overwhelm this reliance can effectively force cancers out of indefinite remodeling. • ATR and CHK1 inhibitors: Validated preclinical and clinical studies show that cancers with high replication stress (e.g., MYC-driven, BRCA-deficient) are hypersensitive to ATR/CHK1 inhibition. These drugs remove the buffering capacity that sustains chronic Passage 2, forcing unresolved gaps to collapse. This does not guarantee differentiation, but it disrupts the proliferative limbo that defines the trap. • MiDAS dependency: Cancer cells disproportionately rely on mitotic DNA synthesis at fragile sites. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting RAD52, POLD3, or MUS81 selectively harms tumor cells, as normal tissues rely less heavily on MiDAS. This provides a mechanistic way to cut off a Passage 2 salvage valve. • Replication origin targeting: Agents that reduce nucleotide supply (e.g., hydroxyurea, thymidylate synthase inhibitors) or hyperactivate origins (oncogene mimicry) can push tumors into catastrophic RS. While toxic, these strategies echo the same principle: exploiting cancers’ unsustainable commitment to perpetual remodeling. Model implication: Forcing cancers out of Passage 2 does not mean “forcing them into death.” It means collapsing their tolerance mechanisms so that the only outcomes left are differentiation, apoptosis, or senescence — the outcomes Passage 3 was designed to enforce. Re-weighting Passage 3 Outcomes For those cells that reach Passage 3, the therapeutic aim is to bias exit toward productive or non-pathological fates. • Differentiation therapy: The archetype is acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), where all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide degrade PML-RARA and release blocked differentiation. This validates that cancers stuck in proliferative states can be therapeutically shifted into resolution. Ongoing efforts are testing similar approaches in other leukemias (e.g., IDH inhibitors restoring differentiation in AML). • Apoptosis sensitization: BH3 mimetics (e.g., venetoclax) tilt the balance of Passage 3 toward programmed elimination by neutralizing anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins. Importantly, these agents are most effective in tumors already under metabolic or replication stress, where burden is high — consistent with the logic of Passage 3 weighting. • Senescence induction: CDK4/6 inhibitors enforce G1 arrest and can push tumor cells into a terminal senescent state. While senescence is not irreversible in all contexts, pairing these inhibitors with immune checkpoint blockade can facilitate clearance, making senescence a viable resolution pathway. • Polyploidization/fusion targeting: Some cancers exploit aberrant endoreplication or cell fusion to sustain heterogeneity. Drugs that interfere with Aurora kinases, mitotic checkpoints, or fusogenic pathways can re-balance these abnormal exits toward more stable differentiation or apoptosis. Speculation: The future of therapy may not be a binary between cytotoxicity and cytostasis, but passage tuning — adjusting the relative weighting of differentiation, death, fusion, and polyploidization to reimpose the resolution logic cancers evade. Lineage-Specific Exploitation of Stress Topographies Because mutation spectra reflect lineage-specific stress landscapes, therapies can be tailored to exploit these inherent vulnerabilities. • Breast/ovarian (BRCA1/2 loss): PARP inhibitors exploit dependency on BER for gap repair at R-loop–prone regions, a lineage-specific weak point. • Gliomas (ATRX loss): Targeting ALT pathways or reinforcing telomere replication stress may selectively impair ATRX-deficient tumors. • Hematologic malignancies: Leveraging ROS-modulating drugs or exploiting FoxO pathway dysfunction may help force HSC-derived cancers toward apoptosis or differentiation. • T-ALL: Interventions that modulate transcription–replication conflicts (e.g., RNase H2 upregulation, R-loop–targeting agents) may destabilize the proliferative trap. Each example reflects a principle: use the lineage’s normal stress geography against it. By targeting the very vulnerabilities that define developmental Passage 2 in that tissue, cancers can be stripped of their ability to linger indefinitely in remodeling. Toward Regenerative Medicine The same passage framework has implications beyond cancer. Directed differentiation of stem cells in regenerative medicine often fails because cells resist stable lineage commitment, oscillating between proliferative and partially differentiated states. By understanding DDR intermediates as drivers of developmental transitions, regenerative strategies could purposefully modulate replication stress, gap tolerance, or repair-coupled transcription to mimic natural passage logic. For example, mild replication stress or controlled induction of BER intermediates may promote enhancer activation and accelerate lineage fidelity — provided Passage 3 resolution is preserved to prevent transformation risk. Synthesis Therapies framed through the passage system emphasize restoring resolution, not just inflicting damage. For cancers trapped in Passage 2, this means collapsing unsustainable tolerance mechanisms. For cells that do reach Passage 3, it means re-weighting outcomes toward differentiation, apoptosis, or senescence rather than pathological persistence. And for regenerative medicine, it means using DDR intermediates as tools to guide fate transitions safely. The unifying idea is that DDR is not only a target but a developmental axis — one that can be tuned to either dismantle malignant proliferation or enhance regenerative fidelity, depending on how passages are weighted.. Conclusions and Perspectives The DNA damage response has long been framed as the “guardian of the genome,” a surveillance network designed to detect, halt, and repair lesions. Yet accumulating evidence from developmental biology, stem cell research, and cancer genomics reframes DDR as more than a defensive shield. It is also a developmental architect, orchestrating how cells inherit, remodel, and ultimately resolve chronic stress. By situating this within a three-passage framework—asymmetry (Passage 1), proliferative remodeling (Passage 2), and terminal resolution (Passage 3)—we gain a new lens through which to interpret both normal differentiation and malignant transformation. In normal development, this architecture ensures that stress is not erased but harnessed. Replication gaps, R-loops, oxidative lesions, and under-replicated regions are tolerated and buffered, then used to license transcriptional remodeling, open chromatin, and activate lineage-defining programs. Through asymmetric segregation, transit amplification, and diverse terminal exits, chronic stress is integrated into differentiation rather than being treated solely as a threat. The remarkable diversity of outcomes at Passage 3—differentiation, programmed elimination, fusion, or polyploidization—underscores that the system is flexible yet purposeful, channeling progenitors into non-proliferative fates that preserve tissue integrity. Cancer represents the corruption of this architecture. Tumors do not abandon DDR logic; they remain governed by it, but the balance is skewed. Many cancers are effectively trapped in a prolonged Passage 2–like state, proliferating under chronic replication stress but failing to progress into resolution. Mutational hotspots in p53, RB, BRCA1/2, ATR, and CHK1 highlight the regulatory nodes that normally enforce passage fidelity. Moreover, lineage-specific mutation patterns reflect the normal geography of stress—R-loops at hormone-responsive loci in mammary cells, telomeric replication blocks in neural progenitors, oxidative stress in hematopoietic stem cells, and transcriptional collisions in T-cell precursors. The cancer genome thus becomes a map of failed passage management, recording both regulatory failure and lineage-specific vulnerabilities. This reframing carries significant therapeutic and regenerative implications. For cancer, it suggests that interventions should not only damage DNA further but also rebalance passage outcomes. Forcing cancers out of the Passage 2 trap through ATR/CHK1 inhibition or MiDAS disruption, re-weighting Passage 3 exits with differentiation therapy or BH3 mimetics, and exploiting lineage-specific stress topographies represent rational strategies grounded in developmental logic. For regenerative medicine, the lesson is inverse: by deliberately modulating DDR intermediates—controlled replication stress, BER-coupled demethylation, or R-loop resolution—stem cells may be guided into stable differentiation while minimizing transformation risk. Looking forward, three avenues appear most urgent. First, quantitative tracking of passages in vivo: lineage tracing combined with reporters for replication gaps, 53BP1 nuclear bodies, and mitochondrial asymmetry could test whether asymmetric burden, transit remodeling, and flexible exit occur as predicted. Second, functional dissection of non-stochastic mutation patterns: linking fragile-site instability, R-loop hotspots, and oxidative lesions in specific tissues to observed cancer signatures would establish whether the mutational landscape truly reflects passage logic. Third, therapeutic proof-of-principle studies: beyond ATRA in APL, can other cancers be driven to resolution by tuning passage outcomes, and can regenerative protocols safely mimic these mechanisms? In sum, reframing DDR as a developmental architect illuminates common ground between differentiation and cancer. It explains why chronic damage can be both a driver of specialization and a source of instability, depending on whether passage fidelity is maintained. It suggests that cancer’s defining features—proliferation, resistance to death, and genomic instability—are not alien but distorted echoes of developmental programs. And it offers a conceptual bridge between oncology and regenerative medicine: both fields hinge on our ability to modulate how cells inherit, tolerate, and resolve damage across passages. Perspective: If tested and validated, this passage framework would recast DNA damage not merely as a problem to be fixed, but as a currency of cell fate. In doing so, it could unify two of biology’s central challenges—how tissues differentiate in development and how they break in cancer—under a single architectural principle.",

I began pumping in the mid-1990s having started with Medtronic pumps before switching to Tandem Tslim X2 with control IQ. Now in year 2 of my second Tslim X2 having run out of warranty on the first. I like my Tslim X2. It has helped improve my A1Cs from those I was able to achieve prior to switching to it. I complained about the subject of this post directly to Tandem in one of their customer surveys in the past, over a year ago. I also spoke on the phone with someone at Tandem when they saw my unsatisfied rating in the survey I took. I made it clear that there is a wealth of information and experience we senior T1s have to offer. When I look at the [tandemdiabetes.com](http://tandemdiabetes.com) website as a senior patient, I feel unseen. Just browse it for yourself and look at the photos and blog articles. See many gray haired retirees? I do not. (Honestly, I \\*did\\* see \\*one\\* blog article about a guy my age diagnosed in 1972 who was running across Texas.) Not trusting my viewing abilities, I tried google site searches (limiting the search to just tandemdiabetes.com) for some keywords. For example: site:tandemdiabetes.com \"geriatric\" and other keywords like \"retiree\" with no results returned. Words like \"retired\" or \"senior\" yielded only hits for retired software or senior company managers. So either my search words are poor, or they are good but there is nothing to find because they don't care enough about senior T1 diabetics. Before anyone writes, \"Ok, boomer!\" please inform me of what I am missing here. Am I wrong, and is Tandem paying attention to and offering anything specific because of a senior patient's needs? For example, avoiding alert sound frequencies (or making them adjustable) to avoid those frequencies commonly lost or diminished in seniors. Bigger fonts for my aging eyes (though I guess they have punted that to the phone app, assuming the phone is certified for use with the pump and app (a separate rant point for me)). The very least Tandem could do is make me feel like my age demographic is represented via their choice of photos on their website. For some additional perspective on senior pump usage, reference (especially the Conclusions): \"Benefits and challenges of diabetes technology use in older adults\" [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6983469/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6983469/) I also stumbled over this while composing this rant: *\"When Type 1 Diabetes Strikes Older Adults\"* [https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/when-type-1-diabetes-strikes-older-adults](https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/when-type-1-diabetes-strikes-older-adults) Quoting the article: \"*Though type 1 diabetes is often thought of as a disease that appears in childhood—and was even called juvenile diabetes before the 1980s—about half of new cases of type 1 each year are diagnosed in older adults.\"* If that is an accurate statistic (I am dubious given it was not footnoted), then I would \\*really\\* expect to see more focus on seniors on the Tandem website.",

We know from Varacek \"fireside\" end of FEB that there were 5 locations thru IRB process--another 8 locations in various phase of IRB process--and another approx 25 more sites that SeaStar is engaged with ( @ 15 mins mark here--https://s201.q4cdn.com/298572669/files/doc\\_events/2025/Feb/27/SeaStar-Fireside-Chat-2.mp4 ) This is the U S News ranking of Pediatric nephrology hospitals --https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings/nephrology Per SeaStar , 10 of the top 50 hospitals have prior experience with Quelimmune \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ So some of the known unknown \\#1--What is the # of treated patients/data that will allow the registry decouple process to happen this year?? (this is 1 of SeaStar 2025 goals) \\#2--IF the top 50 PED hospitals (220 PED hosp in U S) treat 50% of PED-AKI--is that somewhat linear and top 25 hosp treat 25% of PED-AKI?? IF that is the case then top 25 hosp would be treating approx 1,000 patients per year. This should be 20+ million $$ per year ( @ 20,000$$ per patient) \\#3--When a location such as Texas Childrens/Houston is added--does that incl all their locations ??--they have a Austin,TX branch also. Or is that sep IRB by health system or sep IRB by state law or another factor?? \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ SeaStar pretty much hits their goals. Some have not been \"timely\" but steps have been methodical So for 2025 the \"20 hospital systems\" shown here should be hopefully closer to 25 and the adult trial full enrollment is maybe still on DEC track with todays 119 of 200 update https://preview.redd.it/fnakp4e4w9df1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef9afcede17e25414146e88d93c624db51539f8b",

          "selftext": "“Coming up on the crash site now,” Ny’eem reported, her tactical suit sensors recording visuals as she spoke, “no movement.” Despite the thick fog and dense foliage, of which was dark and gloomy, her visor faintly out lined the downed fighter-craft. It was rather... *primitive* from what she could see that wasn’t covered by the misty fog. She was far from an aerospace engineer, but she could make out that the ship was comprised of metals, or at least what appeared to be metals. “How did that scrap pile even fly?” Jasneir, the onboard engineer, said from Ny’eem’s helmet comm. “Doesn’t matter,” the Commander cut in, “Ny’eem, give me a closer look.” “Yes, ma’am,” she said as she shifted slowly closer to the ominous craft. Her feet plopped into the knee-high water and sank into the black mud below her. A soft *spelunk* reverberated with every step. There was chirping all around her from the shrouded planet. The calls of thousands of tiny bugs speaking to the night that always stopped as she came closer to the miniature beasts. *Spelunk.* *Spelunk.* *Spelunk.* By now she could hear a faint beeping coming from the alien craft. It was high-pitched and steadily pacing itself onward, refusing to end. Ny’eem slid her hand to the rail under her gun and flipped on the attached flashlight. The glaring light bounced off the hull of the ship and illuminated the inky trees around her, confirming her suspicion of the craft being constructed of metal. *Spelunk.* *Spelunk.* *Spelunk...* *Clink.* Her foot pounded on something hard she couldn’t see. The chirping stopped. She froze, finger on the trigger as she shook quietly in her suit. She waited. Both her hearts pounded in her chest and her front molars clamped her mouth shut. Her eyes darted around, searching for danger, before coming to their senses and surveying what was below her. It was the wing. The wing to the stupid alien ship. She let out a rasped breath. Her were lungs grateful she had finally remembered to breathe and she shuffled closer to the craft. Now she was almost on top of the blasted thing and made out what she interpreted as the pilot’s seating and controls. Empty. It was a little small though, as if it was designed to fit a teen of her species or something. A series of soft red lights blinked slowly at the controls and some sort of gas was rising from behind a rip in the metal plates. There was also a stick protruding from the flooring that sat right in front of the seat. “What in Divines?” Ny’eem’s comms erupted and she squealed. “Jasneir,” Ny’eem spoke, heat in her voice, “please don’t do that again.” “Oh, uh, sorry. But look at it. How can something be so dumb and still work?” Ny’eem sighed and said nothing. “Could you do me a favor and open up those controls?” Once again Ny’eem said nothing, but checked her surroundings again before kneeling down. She glanced to where the gas leaked. Was it leaking? Or was that normal for this craft? She couldn’t smell anything. The suit used a nitrogen tank instead of breathing in the rich oxygen air. It wasn’t harmful to Fangorna like herself, but it would give headaches after a while. She hesitated for a moment, then slowly drifted a hand off her weapon and inspected the alien controls delicately. Would it explode if she messed with it? She swallowed and timidly pried the metal sheet off the control panel. It came off rather easily, which came as no surprise to her. Fangorna tended to pride themselves on their strength after all. The gas that had been leaking, now exploded into a cloud of dense smoke. Revealing a red beam being pointed at her chest from the darkness beyond. Her flight instincts took over and she dove off to the side. Just as a thunderous crash exploded behind her. She splashed into the water and scrabbled to a tree for cover. The black mud clung to her suit, weighing her down in her desperate crawl for salvation. Another explosion and splinters scattered as the tree collapsed on top of her, wedging her between the log and the stump. She cried in terror, bewildered at the sudden violence. “Ny’eem, hang on. Help is on the way,” the Commander shouted in her ears. She whimpered into the comms. She wasn’t a soldier! She was barely even considered to be security. Her instincts told her to hunker down and hide from whatever predatory being was out there. Was she going to get eaten? Predators always went after the farthest from the herd. Her rifle was stuck on her chest but her hands were free. She gripped the belly of the log and heaved it into the air. Breath ragged, she snatched her weapon and dashed behind another tree, weaving through them like a small mammal. \\------- “Jesus Christ,” Hudson said in awe. He watched as the large alien lifted the meter thick log off itself like it was nothing and flee into the swamp. Alien ship shooting at him? Great. Crashlanding? Acceptable. Stranded on an unknown world? Fine, he could deal with that. But now those same aliens could lift hundreds of pounds like it was nothing? Hell no! They even appeared to be human. A woman to be more accurate, with curves in surprisingly all the right places. First contact with aliens ended up with him getting shot down by them before he even knew what was going on. At least now he knew aliens existed, and they weren’t the most welcoming bunch. He’d certainly have to report this back to command, assuming he could make it off world in the first place. And get back to Terran space... without a ship... It didn’t help that his targeting systems in his HUD were malfunctioning after the crash. The darkness of this world was also an added bonus. He should have nailed the creature right in the heart. Or where a human would have a heart at least. But no, that damned alien had to have seen his targeting laser in the smoke. Outstanding luck on his end. He fired his railgun again into the swamp. Not aiming at anything in particular, just the general direction of the alien. Hopefully it would think he was still chasing it. Not that he wasn’t. \\------- “It’s following me!” Ny’eem screamed as she ran for her life. “Don’t lead it here,” Jasneir said angrily. “Just keep running. Don’t stop,” the Commander encouraged, “we’ve almost got you.” “Please don’t let me die,” she begged to her herd. “You’re not going to die.” Ny’eem slipped and slammed into the water again, sinking slowly into the mud. She lay there. Her legs burned and her arms felt weak. Her breath filled her ears and her lungs begged for a respite. This was easily the most physically intensive thing she’d done in a few months. “Ny’eem? Are you hit?” “N-no, ma’am,” she rasped as she pushed herself up. Her arms shook but she managed to get on her feet again and hauled herself closer to safety. A bright floodlight flickered on, blinding her. “Ny’eem, we see you. It’s going to be okay,” the Commander said soothingly over the comms. Her voice was like an angel from the Divines to her ears. She collapsed and tears ran down her pale blue skin. Arms wrapped around her and held her tight. “It’s okay, you’re okay. We got you.” “Please get me out of here.” “Hyhsia, get the trauma room ready.” “Yes, ma’am,” the alien responded. \\------- Hudson couldn’t help but feel... resentment, for the alien that was barely thirty meters from him. Who he decided he was going to name “Crybaby.” Breaking down after a tiny firefight where only a handful of shots were fired at her and this is how she responded? Lord have mercy on these creatures if this was their norm. He leveled his gun at the two newcomers. The first, who was currently holding the crybaby in its arms, was about the same size as the first, also humanoid. He could see bright yellow skin through the shielded lower half of her helmet. “Yellow” it is. The third, was quite different form the other two. This one had six arms. Long and spiny, they reminded him of bugs but with hands. “Xeno” he dubbed (Hudson didn’t know what else to call it since they definitely looked feminine to him) was holding an incredibly bright flashlight that was brighter than floodlights. Part of him wanted to blast them down. He could definitely get a kill at this range, and with so many targets, he could pick and choose the easiest to hit. It just felt *wrong* to shoot them while they were so vulnerable. Instead, he decided he was going to observe. Xeno must have a heard something, because her head snapped in his direction and she shouted something. He froze and his finger tightened around the trigger. \\------- “It’s here!” Tesna, who Ny’eem just realized was there, shouted before an explosion ended the relative silence. Her six arms shielding her from the debris. “Get back to the ship,” the Commander ordered, pulling Ny’eem to her feet. They bolted away from the blast and used trees and other foliage to hide themselves from the monster’s grasp. Another blast quickly followed and water rained on top of her. What kind of weapon could deliver such a powerful blow in such a rapid succession? Was it some kind of fully automatic explosive launcher? The Commander threw Ny’eem behind a bush and pulled out a rifle of her own. She flicked a switch and the weapon clicked repeatedly to life. Ny’eem witnessed the laser pulse a few times, sending out several straight green lasers in a mere instant, before the Commander ducked behind a tree. Tesna’s rifle also clicked and she let out a few bursts of light of her own. There was silence again, save for the laser rifle’s clicking. Then the was a sharp voice from the darkness. \\------- “Holy shit!” Hudson shouted as the swamp around him was suddenly engulfed in flames. Wood crackled under the fire and he gave up on engaging the aliens. He jumped down from the tree he was using and splashed into the water. For a second, he struggled to get feet out of the mud, but it let go of him after a hard tug. He sprinted away from the fire and slung his rifle over his shoulder. Pumping his arms and legs he quickly multiplied the distance between him and the creatures. \\------- Ny’eem let out a sigh of relief. Now that she was finally on board the ship, and specifically in the trauma room with the Commander and Tesna, her body ached with exhaustion as she lay on a comfortable bed. The chamber itself was quite spacious when compared to the rest of the ship but walls were still milky white like everything else. All three of the females on the beds had been stripped of their armor and were now in their uniforms. The Commander’s yellow skin was as perfect as ever, illuminating her role. In contrast to Ny’eem’s pale blue skin, which sentenced her to manual labor and security. Tesna and Hyhsia, both Arachnus, had a sickly tan skin tone and, much to Ny’eem disappointment, skin color didn’t matter to the insectoids nearly as much as it did to Fangorna. Hyhsia stood over her and ran a scanner in the air, her six arms completing multiple tasks in unison. “Hmm, that’s surprising,” she said then walked to the Commander. “No mental scarring from Ny’eem, Commander. Tesna will need to be delivered to a medical station before her scarring becomes fatal. As for you...,” once again she wiped the air with her scanner, “you’ll need some psychological therapy for a few weeks, but you can still carry out your duties. No more interaction with predators for a while, you hear me? That goes for all of you.” The Commander raised an eyebrow and sat up, “giving out orders now, are we?” “The herd’s mental and physical health is where I outrank you, Commander,” she said matter-of-factly. She put a hand on the Commander’s shoulder and gently pushed her down. The Commander folded her arms, but didn’t resist. A frown signaled her displeasure. “Ny’eem,” Hyhsia called as she turned to face her, “You’re lucky. No wounds. No mental scarring. It seems you’re highly resilient, that, or this ‘predator’ is highly incompetent.” “He almost killed me several-” she stopped as soon as she realized she was defending the monster. The doctor eyed her. “Clearly.” “Commander,” the comms of the ship said, “your presence is requested at the bridge.” The female stood up, sharing a glare with Hyhsia, before leaving through the doorway. Ny’eem slowly sat straight and looked to the doctor for permission. A small nod later and she followed the Commander out. Tesna, however stayed. On the bridge Ny’eem recognized Jasneir and their pilot, Gaebli, seated in front of a medium sized screen. “Mind telling me what’s going on here?” the Commander questioned irritably. Jasneir perked up. “So I was watching the exterior camera’s, right?” She spoke quickly and paused, as if waiting for someone to agree with her. When silence was her answer, she continued, “you know, just in case you were being followed?” There was an audible ‘oh’ from the Commander. “So anyway, I was just going from camera to camera when I saw *this*,” she said and pointed at a dark tree. “That’s a tree,” the Commander said. “Look closer.” Ny’eem squinted her eyes and leaned forward. The tree was rather odd. It was extremely small for one of the natives and in fact, it looked more like a large bush than anything. The more she looked closer, however, the more she concluding it was not a bush. Rather, it looked like someone had strapped foliage onto themselves to blend in. *Oh no*, she thought. “It’s here,” she whispered. “But we drove it off,” the Commander replied. The figure shifted off to the side, but the camera followed it. Jasneir put one finger from each hand up to the screen and zoomed it in. The thing was smaller than her, more like the size of a young teenager. Bipedal and two arms with a single head mounted on its torso. It appeared to be another Fangorna, only missing the natural curves at the... Ny’eem’s jaw dropped. “Do you see it? I think it’s a dude.” Gaebli commented, knocking Ny’eem out of her awestruck state. “We’re being hunted by a *male*!” Jasneir gleamed, quivering in excitement where she sat. The other seated Fangorna glared at her in disappointment. “I think I had a dream about th-this.” “Was it a wet dream?” Ny’eem couldn’t help but ask with a grin. The stress had worn away and she was more than happy to tease her herd-mate. “N-no,” she exclaimed bashfully. Ny’eem turned her attention back to the screen. *Why did it follow them?* she thought. Her curiosity was engulfed by the creature. *Was it another Fangorna? Something else? Was it really a predator? Was it scared?* The questions flared through her mind. She didn’t know. She intended to find out. &amp;#x200B; &amp;#x200B; This is the first time I've posted on, well, anything. So if it sucks, oh well.

          "selftext": "[**Meeki As Promised!**](https://www.deviantart.com/demonicking101/art/Meeki-GRATT-WNAD-904733837?ga_submit_new=10%3A1642948725&amp;ga_type=edit&amp;ga_changes=1) **Chapter Twenty Six: Take My Love, Take My Land** “The sky… is *falling*…” Nodrin says, their mind yet to process what apocalyptic spendor plays out above. Metal crafts without the need of any sort of large balloon or gas sack fly in the air at impossible speeds and perform incredibly sharp turns. The initial dissenting demon-bringers coated in red are beset by far more aggressive crafts in a vast array of different shapes. Like mythical beasts of old they fluidly soar, expelling breaths of blur and orange flames that travel faster than fireworks. Red crafts that have yet to touch down on the city streets start to flee back into the sky as their assailants utterly annihilate them without an ounce of mercy. “*They’re… not from underground…*” Meeki mutters in awe just before a red craft explodes above, sending its fractured carcass down towards the couple. Nodrin takes hold of their bondmate and leaps toward a narrow alleyway. By the skin of their fangs the two barrel between buildings just before the craft impacts. The thing blisters the street tearing up cobblestone like a shovel through gravel. Flames burst forth in concentrated plumes from several cracks in the craft’s exterior, followed by an internal eruption. Buildings adjacent to it are overcome by a shockwave carrying liquid flame and molten alien metals. Unable to withstand it, the building just on the couple’s left caves in upon the street. The two crawl ahead through the alley as they are soon blinded by clouds of hot ash and dust. Holding on to one another they press on until they feel a solid wall blocking the way forward. A dead end within this increasingly unbreathable air. They stagger up against it, feeling for any footholds to climb up, but have no such luck. Looking back, Meeki considers the risk of going back to navigate through the wreckage. But the heat alone coming from that direction alone dissuades such an option. Out of desperation she takes out an arrow and stabs it into the wall to perhaps make her own footing, but the stone surface only suffers a scratch. Even though Nodrin is up against her, she can barely make out their silhouette. She wants to say something, apologies for drawing them into this chaos. That out of all the Gratt they could have bonded with, it was she who they followed. She reaches her head to touch his, but a loud pumping sound occurs. Both of their focus targets back to where the craft crashed. A rushing breeze aggressively comes up to them as hot and *cold* air displace one another. An odd chemical stench fills the air overpowering all else, and another similar breeze is felt. It’s almost calming when the intense heat dissipates, but before either Gratt can investigate several lights start emerging from the haze. Pairs of soft circular red lights grow closer, along with the sounds of multiple clacking footsteps. Uncertain of these creatures seemingly escaping out of a pyre, Meeki raises her bow. “**Stay away!**” she orders, closer to believing in demons now more than ever. The footsteps slow greatly, but don’t quite stop. One then speaks in a direct yet soft chirping-like voice. “Chiklatic, tac mikacha tiik…” There is urgency, but no aggression as far as the Gratt can tell. Before Meeki can respond another voice follows. “*Air good not. Capital time we cause help.*” these spoken words sound as though they are spoken through a rattling tube, while being sent through a malfunctioning radio. Unlike the cave-folk, these creatures have a peculiar method to communicate in something that resembles the Gratt’s language. Though it’s almost nonsense, the intent comes across. Or at least… Meeki *hopes* she understands the intent. She lowers her bow, allowing the strangers to approach. When they do, the silhouettes with red glowing eyes reach up and press something to their neck over their breathing vents. Although initially twitchy regarding the contact, the sudden realization of fresh air coming from whatever is being held against them is incredibly welcomed. Pressing their hands over their other opposing exposed vents, they intake sweet clean oxygen. Comforted, they allow these strange people to guide them through the clouds of ash, and navigate around searing hot sections of metal. It’s hard to tell for certain, but the Gratt hear what could be another craft above the wreckage expelling something over it. Whatever it is, it's cold and leaves a thick oily taste in the air. Much more preferable to a suffocating burning inferno in any case. As they are led away from the wreckage and the ashes begin to clear, the couple start to make out the strangers’ appearance in detail. They are completely covered in suits of strange armor that have glass facial covers. And unlike Gratt or Cave-folk have an extra pair of arms that don’t have complex graspers. Around them are four of these individuals boxing them in… *protectively*? Each is armed with various and strange looking rifles that make no sense with initial glances. However as the escort moves around the corner a vessel lands on the outskirts of an out of sight skirmish, unloading another group of these six limbed people. As they run out charging they fire their weapons to which cast what looks like pure magical energy. After laying down incredible power only wielded by gods, they move out of sight deeper into the fray. Meeki’s imagination runs wild as to who these people are and their relations with the Cave-folk. Are they at war from a place far into the stars? Are the Cave-folk the aggressors or the strangers? Are the Cave-folk on the run from these people? Is that why they were so desperate to take the city? So many unknowns around these unfolding cataclysmic happenings from beyond the sky itself. Though Meeki concedes that there is undoubtedly nothing she nor her people can do at this point. The fate of the Gratt is up to these strangers from the stars, and hopefully their heroic nature proves long term. \\- **“Ayyye! Long time no see my dude!”** Dave declares as the barely conscious Simone is rolled into the Kwip-chap’s medbay. Her eyes lazily take in the incredibly familiar surroundings, feeling as though she now exists in a lucid dream or previous life. Flashes of memories fall into place, and bit by bit her life slowly comes back. She holds on to each memory as if they could slip away at any moment, but they thankfully don’t. Dave’s scanning light flickers as Seven carefully scoots the redhead over before it. **“Oh fuck dude… like, ignoring your gnarly boo-boos you have at least** ***three*** **unidentified parasites crawling around in ya. And someone make this bitch a big-ass-heart-clogging sandwich! She’s like, waaay into malnourished territory here! Doctor’s orders!”** Seven nods their cranium and floats away in a hurry. “*Dave?...*” Simone practically mouths out. **“Sup she-hulk?”** Dave replies as it begins tending to the wounds that require immediate attention. “*Please… take it off… before they make me hurt someone…*” she begs. **“Hey… I will bud, promise. I have my own gizmos, plus the ship’s keeping signals from reaching ya. But that thing is literally linked into your brain matter like a dynamite buttplug. So it’s gonna require a fuck-ton of my concentration and time to get it outta ya. Right now I gotta make sure you don’t die from the more immediate problemos.”** Dave explains right before pulling out a small but long, purple mucus coated creature that screeches out in a high ringing pitch from Simone’s abdomen before safely sealing it in a clear container. “*Okay…*” the redhead utters as she allows herself to fully relax. The now helmetless Cali standing next to her is gently petting her head soothingly, careful not to interrupt Dave’s work. “I knew you were still alive…” Chak tells Simone, “I’m so sorry we didn’t find you sooner. I’m sorry that this all happened… I should have-” “*Shhhh…*” Simone interrupts before the princess can claim any blame, “*This… is from* my *baggage… my past… If anything… I’m lucky to have you… because no one else would have come looking for a fuck like me… No one else cares… about me… like you do… thank you… Chak…*” she says, far too out of it to move a hand up to touch Chak’s face like she wants to. In fact her eyelids are just as heavy as the rest of her body, her mind slipping in and out of focus. Chak leans in closer to kiss the dirtied brow of her lover. “*Everyone on this ship cares just as much as I do… Each and every one of us.*” she whispers. **“Hate to butt-in here bruh, but ms. Gets-hit-a-lot is gonna need to go under and rest for a bit. I pinky promise I’ll get that pesky BrainScrambler-9000tm or whatever removed within the hour!”** Dave informs. “Oh, of course. I’ll just be checking in with my brother, I won’t be far.” Chak replies before giving the redhead one more reassuring stroke through her matted fur. Before unconsciousness takes her, Simone watches the Cali leave. “*Be straight with me doc… am I worth saving?*” she asks drowsily. Dave doesn’t answer right away, instead the machine works in silence for a solid second. Almost as if distracted by thought. **“Is** ***anybody***? **Not to start sounding like Seven-the-awoken-hippy-bot, but to the whole flip’n universe everyone is like…** ***inconsequential***\\*\\*! There’s no purpose for you flesh bags outside the purpose you\\*\\* ***bestow*** **on yourselves. You heard the bug-lady, look around ya! You’re worth it to ‘em at the very least my dude.”** Simone smiles softly. *“What about you?... miss me much?... Or are ya… too much of a bucket of bolts?*” **“Bruh, this ‘bucket of bolts’ is stitchin’ ya back together better than any organic life form could! Now be** ***nice*** **to the auto-surgeon and hope it doesn’t stitch a permanent phallic shape into your side while you're unconscious.”** \\- Looking up at the sky once more, there’s no flying red craft in sight. If they didn’t flee into the dark abyss, then they were struck down. Yet still the battle within the village of Topaiia still rages on. Though now the stranger’s navy of the sky propels warriors and magic flames down upon the invaders. Meeki and Nodrin are escorted further back into the village where a true refuge for warriors is established. These strangers have fully organized an encampment of sorts. Tents of exotic smooth material lines up the sides of the city streets. Food, water and even medical care is handed out by their star-bound saviors. Not even an hour before, all hope in survival was all but lost. Now… *many* are able to tell the stories of when the wars of stars came down upon the Gratt people. “Meeki? Meeki is that you?” an older voice calls out. She turns to an open tent where injured higher ranked militia and guardsmen are being tented to. The one who calls out is barely able to tilt his head up to see her. Half of his face is coated in a strange medical bandaging, but the visage of Chief Warden Donrick is unmistakable. “Yes sir!” Meeki replies as she approaches, her mate and escort close by, “I’m so glad to see you’ve survived. We thought the chapel was completely overrun before these- uhm… people arrived.” Donrick nods. “Indeed… It was well fought, but we fell. I found myself up in the tower with that- *individual* you came back with in fact. She… sheltered my body when it was beset by a sky ship… but my consciousness failed me soon after.” Meeki’’s ears droop from the guilt of possibly being part of this whole attack, but then something clicks in her mind. “*She* saved you?” Meeki inquires. Donrick nods and sets his head back on his pillow. “That one was a female. Our guests -*well to be honest*\\- our *saviors* told me such. Our Jarl is currently speaking to their leader. A prince from the stars if you could believe something so fanciful. Hard to believe monarchies would exist in a civilization that- *bah* I’m distracting myself now. Listen, they have a radio-like device that learns language and translates it. Each time one of their doctors comes by to check on me, their words are clearer and clearer. It’s quite fascinating that- *bah*… What I’m trying to tell you is to go to the Jarl and Prince. The Prince seems especially inserted in the one that first found and brought in that female Terroon. *Turon? Turrian? Bah…* whatever they call them.” Meeki lifts her hands defensively. “Sir… I’m just a ranger who has yet to settle. My bondmate and I have yet to even officially request settlement here. I’m not sure if I have the right to place myself within such talks.” she points out. “Perhaps, but their Prince was very clear in meeting with you if you had survived. And worry not young ranger, you are not to blame for what happened on this day.” the old man waves away. “But how could you know-” “The situation at hand is no mere war. The Prince will inform you I’m sure. Now go, don’t leave our savior’s leader waiting.” Donrick dismisses more firmly. “Y-yes sir. Rest well, you have earned a hero’s spirit.” Meeki farewells, turning back to her escort hesitantly speaking up to them, “Did you overhear all that? Can you take me to your prince?” she asks. “Cheirit antait Bromalata’motaas klita.” one says with a head bow, a moment later that strange followup voice clarifies “Indeed, it is a priority to take you to Bromalata’motaas.'' Although stiff, Meeki is pleasantly surprised by how improved the words have come from near-gibberish. “My bondmate, Nodrin. They may come as well?” Meeki asks before Nodrin can attempt to. “Chit-na.”, “Yes.” they affirm before leading the couple down the street to a landed craft with a wide opening to enter. The Gratt hesitates and halts at the sheer intimidating power that this craft not only wields but also *represents*. Something perhaps their kind was to accomplish one day in the far future. It’s like they didn’t belong in the same proximity with such technology that might as well be magic. “Dig-dig, nikas ta”, “It’s safe, our promise.” a stranger encourages softly. Snapping out of their stupor, the couple link hands and step on into the maw and on to the belly. There’s strange lights, objects and even architecture that makes little sense to the Gratt. Thankfully, they see the Jarl seated across from one of the strangers, clad in scorched yet gleaming armor of silver. “-I see… But like I said, I have no authority for all of the Gratt people. Such decisions for a global scale would require our entire governing systems to be rebuilt from the ground up. Such an endeavor in time alone…” the Jarl says to the presumed Prince. “I understand, but with your people now exposed to interstellar happenings and technology according to Central Galactic law your species must be formally cataloged and introduced to the stars. Leaving you with this knowledge and scraps of technology -especially in the possession of a deathworlder species- it would be unethical to leave you to your own devices at this point. The Cali people are willing to aid in efforts to establish your kind to the grandest of communities.” the Prince’s after-voice explains. “You keep referring to us as that… ‘Deathworlder’... I assure you our world flourishes with life, as I hope you can tell.” the Jarl points out, tapping her claw into the magically glowing table. “Of course, it’s no term meant for insult. It’s a classification. Most species were raised on worlds that don’t have such… *aggressively competitive* evolution, temperamental climate, or such force of gravity. I assure you, without this armor I’m wearing I wouldn't be able to live so much as *stand upright* on this world of yours. You’re people will be quite the force amongst the stars, hence why I have little choice but to involve myself and my people to this degree. I was not expecting to be obligated to aid in a whole species’ uplifting when coming to your world, but I will do my duty.” the Prince clarifies. “Do we as a people even have a choice in the matter? What if the will of the Gratt is to deny the stars until we rise to them ourselves?” the Jarl inquires. “We cannot force you to comply, we are extending our grasp to yours. Whether you take it is not our choice to make. However, another rogue group of deathworlders like those Terran terrorists can come across you and do *far* worst things. I swear to you, if they wished to destroy this village with a single shot from the stars… *they very well could have*. I cannot spare a constant defense of your world now that it may be known by others. Allow us to bring one of your leaders to Central Galactic as a voice, and they will guarantee the protection I can’t give. If I must aid in gathering your most prominent leaders to decide together, my ships can assemble them in mere hours. If you were to vouch for us of course, we do not wish to cause more panic than what may already come.” the Prince says, before eyeing the two new guests. The Jarl hunches a bit from all this information, struggling to maintain composure. “*Hours you say*? *Well then*… Very well, I will fully cooperate in organizing and communication. This all just had to fall on my shoulders… such an unexpected yet important role to play. Speaking of which…” the Jarl turns to Meeki and Nodrin, “You two were involved in contacting the first… *Terran*. Correct? The large one with red fur?” “Mostly my doing. We discovered them- *her* in a cave not too far away. She had nothing but a sharpened stick and a fire she started herself.” Meeki confirms, to the great interest of the Prince. He stands at attention, indeed giving an aura of authority in posture. “First I must thank you for giving aid to her. She was kidnapped and forced here against her will. The others of her kin that attacked you were nothing more than a group of fanatic militant cultists. A concerningly large group, but not how the majority of their species conducts themselves. The actual Terran people may be notorious deathworlders, but this is the worst of them. Most are amicable and would be horrified by the actions committed here.” he addresses. Both great relief and terror fill Meeki. It’s absolutely wonderful to hear that these *Terrans* are not all ‘bad’. But the fact that there are *many, many* more out there is still rather unsettling to say the least. “Is she… a friend of yours?” is all Meeki can ask at this moment. The Prince through his clear face plate looks at her amused. “Not quite. But she is very cherished by my sister. To the point where she is… *in a way*… my family.” “You… came here and engaged in a battle for *one* individual?” Nodrin inquires skeptically. “No. We were not expecting an engagement of this magnitude, and would have considered an alternative approach if your people were undisturbed. However since this terrorist group decided to involve you, it became our obligation to step in with force.” the Prince answers clearly, “This is not how first contact laws are normally conducted, however the pressing situation forced our action.” “And… What are your plans once you cleared the invaders’ presence? Are we to submit to your rule? Surely the cost of your rescue won’t be forfeited as an act of charity?” Nodrin firmly presses. Meeki looks to her bondmate baffled that they would be so bold to someone beyond their power in every imaginable way. “Even if I wanted to annex your world, I hardly have the resources or attention to effectively do so. I assure you, my forces are to legally act as guardians, not rulers. Unless we wish to incur the wrath of the most dangerous force in the galaxy of course, which upholds the laws protecting your rights. Believe me, I have no interest in doing such. We will be a little more than an overseeing, advising and transportational presence. But I will admit, this was not purely and act of selflessness. We have our own vital interests in disrupting those who attack you. Weakening them here aids in our own affairs. Once your people are established within the Central Galactic network, you may no longer require us. Though I do hope we can broker mutually beneficial trade deals and an official alliance when that day comes.” the Prince looks back to the Jarl, giving a respectful nod. “Is the red Terran well?” Meeki speaks up. The Prince smiles through his helmet. “Would you like to ask her yourself?” \\- Chak paces the walkway between the mess hall and medbay, communicating to her brother. “The Children of Gaia’s station has completely fled into FTL. Your ships are mopping up those who have been left behind.” she informs. “*Excellent. We have nearly completely driven out the ground forces from this village. However there are a few stubborn holdouts, currently waiting for permission to bomb the locations in question. Many have fled into the surrounding forests as well, so I fear we may have a long term campaign ahead of us. I’m hoping to establish a tracking force with the local military. To start training their soldiers to use our weapons and visual gear. They may be primitive to us, but they sure held their own against one of the most feared Deathworlders. Looks like the Terrans are going to have some more galactic competition soon. How’s yours for that matter?*” he responds with a tired voice. “She just finished her final surgery. Her autosurgeon is compiling a full report for us as we speak, I’m nervous… but thankful to have her back. Thank you Brom.” Chak says genuinely. “*This all came together because of you, sister. If we handle this well, the Gratt may prove to be powerful allies in the future. A thankful society of Deathworlders? An excellent potential asset. But there’s much to do before then. By the way, I’m sending you two of them up to your ship. They are the ones who helped your Terran while she was here. They shall be the first Gratts in space, and I’m hoping to make it a powerful moment for their people. May I trust you in making it so?*” Chak slowed her pace to a stop. “In our set of circumstances… I’ll see what I can do.” she confirms. “*Thank you sister. Be sure to brief me afterwards. And be careful. They seem to be gentle natured people, but they are still inexperienced deathworlders. So keep your armor on while they are there and try to educate them on proper etiquette.*” “Understood. Be well brother.” “*And you, Sister.*” Chak disconnects the line of communication and decides to check back in the medbay. A heavily bandaged Simone rests, her forehead device now fully removed. The redhead’s eyes crack open as the door closes behind the princess. “Hey… Bo Peep…” she says with a smirk. Feeling a great relief and excitement overwhelm her, Chak rushes to the bedside and cups Simone’s head in her hands. “How are you feeling?” Chak chirps, too emotional to think of anything else to say. “Been better…” Simone replies with a slow wink. “Is there anything you need? Water? Food?” Chak asks. “Yeah… I wanna see… everyone…” the Terran says, her eyes already being coated by thick moisture. “Oh, of course, of course-” **“Invitations sent! Helluva welcome party!”** Dave informes with a blinking pattern. “Oh, umm… thank you Dave.” Chak says as she deactivates her prepped comm. Before more conversation can be established, crew members begin rushin down the walkway and into the medbay like their lives depended on it. “Bwhahaha! Simone my lass!” the captain bellows out with his arms open wide, first to enter, “I cannot even begin to express how overjoyed I am to have you back!” his scales a vibrant red. “Hey Cap… Sorry for my… unplanned offshore leave...” Simone jests with a cracking voice, water now leaking down her face. “Ha! All’s forgiven!” From across the way, Seven hovers in with a platter in grasp. “For your recovery, a cheesesteak with extra everything-ing! Please excuse the bread being soggy, but I remember-ber you enjoy the grease-ase! Also! I learned-ed how to make cocoslab pies! Your’our favorite! In case you don’t recall-all!” the bot rapidly informs as it makes its way to set the plaster down next to the medical bed. Simone eyes the food only briefly, before looking up at Seven’s three optical orange lights. “*Th-th.. Tha-nnn-k-k…*” she tries to express gratitude, but the words can’t form past her growing sobs. Her sore arm covers her mouth to stifle herself. Finally, a short stubby legged Noxii arrives carefully carrying a familiar canister. “I hope it’s a comfort that Seven and I have taken great care of the Watathlings in your stead! Though it was absolutely apparent that they preferred *your* presence, and as do I! Welcome back ms. Thatch.” Vin spoke, clearly winded from his longer travel to the medbay. Although rather short, he has no issue lifting up the canister next to Simone. Her covering hand moves to her chest as see watches the babies swim and curiously looks at her familiar visage. Especially the smallest of them. Then the Terran loses it, curling forward she openly weeps. Her brain now free from the device up to this point wasn’t convinced that all the good she found herself surrounded by in the past year was even real… that it happened at all… that… she really had found a home where people cared about her. She wasn’t alone, *she doesn’t have to be alone anymore*. *Fuck*… Then something further happens, that she wasn’t ready for. A Cali kisses her forehead, a Tromple braces her shoulder with his grasper, a Noxii takes hold of her free hand, and an awoken machine starts humming a low rhythmic calming tune. “*I’m home… I’m home…*” she whimpers between snotty huffs. “*You’re home…*” Chak reassures. \\- After Simone is given time to collect herself, she sits the canister of Watahlings in her lap. “Sorry for keeping you away from your family. Hell of a detour, but I promise we’ll get ya there.” she says to the babies, a bit guilty. “That we will!” Chucknuq declares in the affirmative. **“Hate to break up the reunion guys, but I gotta give my patient here some news. So like, totally appreciate a clear-out… Cool babies can stay though, their brains and sense of comprehension are** ***tiiiiiiny***!” Dave announces. Just as everyone is about to comply Simone speaks up. “Actually… I want them here… Whatever it is… I need that.” she insists. **“Nooo promblemo dude! But I’m gonna get serious here,** ***it’s heavy***.” “That’s fine.” Simone confirms before looking to the rest of the crew, “Can ya’ll stay? Please?” “Of course.” Chak agrees, firmly taking hold of her girlfriend’s hand. The rest silently stand by Simone’s side in full support. **“Okay… let’s start with the good news. I don’t think you're going to die.”** “*Hell yeah.*” the redhead nods. **“Bad news… you have the worst brain tumor I’ve ever seen. Like, I checked records… I’m not even sure if calling it a brain tumor is perfectly accurate… but it’s a growth of cells and tissue from your brain matter, so that’s what I’m gonna call it.”** A bit taken aback by this, the crew eyes Simone, gauging her expression. She is certainly concerned, but leans on Dave’s first delivery of good news. “So… I’m gonna need another surgery?” she reasons. **“A surgery can be done… however it may do more harm than good. As you can see;”** a wall screen blinks to life showing a three-dimensional scan of Simone’s brain. And even to those not very familiar with Terran organs, the issue can’t be more obvious, **“This thing is weaved into 40 percent of your brain’s structural tissue and stem. It’s possible for me to scrape it all out and replace it with synthetic or cloned stem cells… but there is no getting around the risk of permanent brain damage or even death. And that’s coming from me. Like, my gizmos are top of the line shit, and the idea of operating on it makes me shit my metaphorical pants.”** “But… you scanned my brain before, right? How can something like this be fucking missed?” the Terran points out, holding back her panic. Thankfully her tight grip is over Chak’s armored hand. **“That’s another thing… this ‘tumor’ can’t be a natural growth. It’s too symmetrical, too** ***perfectly placed***. **I didn’t do molecular-deep scans of your brain before this, so it’s possible I missed it while it’s initial form was dormant. But it’s of my professional opinion… that this growth was engineered and implanted very early on in your life, even as early as** ***infancy***. **That device they placed on your head, ‘activated’ it. My fanciest readings are telling me that there may be some kind of information or data in there. Like, it’s** ***almost*** **like an organic hard drive, though I can’t be sure. I’ve** ***never*** **seen anything like this before.”** Everyone is dead silent. What is there to say? However, Simone bites her inner cheek, trying to put the pieces together. **“But like I said, although this shit’s concerning it’s no longer acting like an aggressive cancer, as if** ***designed*** **to simply be what it is. It’s miraculously not putting any concerning pressure on your brain, so as long as that device I removed** ***remains removed*** **and we keep a close eye on it, You should be able to live the rest of your life without this being a huge issue. Don’t get me wrong, it** ***is*** **a huge fucking issue… just by the fact it’s there. Like, If I need to do any unrelated head surgery it’s gonna be a goddamn nightmare. But listen, we’ll take it day by day, and try to fully grasp what this is. Perhaps something can be done in the future. For now, just know good ‘ol Dave here will take good care of ya in the meantime.”** The following awkward air is broken by Chak. “Are you alright?” she asks Simone softly. Simone looks down at the canister, her mind surprisingly accepting of this insane news after the time she had on that planet. “Not.. *really*? *But*… I’ll take it over being turned into a freewill-less cultist drone. Hell, as long as I can resume my life here with you guys… I’ll be fine.” “We are all here for you, and we cherish your time with us, Simone.” Chucknuq reaffirmed, “It would be an honor for you to continue your duties as the Chief of Security.” “That’s all I can ask for… and that sandwich... I’ve been fucking eating shit that tastes like shit for so fucking long.” the Terran chuckled. “Alright, I think it’s time we give Simone some time to rest.” Chak states, hiding her burning anger for those who did this to her Terran’s brain. But then a communication comes in to her. “*Princess, this is shuttle four dash six. Requesting docking permissions.*” a voice comes in. Suddenly remembering the Gratt guests, Chak stiffens up. “Permission granted, I shall meet you in the loading bay.” she responds before looking at Simone, “Oh, actually, before you rest… there’s *one* more meeting we need to have if that’s okay?”",

          "selftext": "Derringer looked closer at the computer screen. “Major Sharpe, we have an unknown infiltrator, 2 U’s out.” He spoke up. A tall burly man got out of his chair and approached the young corporal. “Are you sure? That's too far out of our range for radar.” Sharpe said, looking over the corporal's shoulder at the computer screen. “Its signal matches UFIPS transponders during slipway travel.” Derringer said. “Keep eyes on, alert me when it's in communication range.” Sharpe said, leaving his shoulder to sit back at the chair he was originally sitting in. “Yes sir.” Derringer said, keeping a note of it, and moving his attention away. The unknown blip on the screen continued to move ever closer, although at a much slower pace than expected. It took 40 minutes before it could be considered within the solar system. Despite entering the system, the blip was still as strong as ever, and still stating that it was traveling faster than light. “Major sharpe, unknown track 3412 is continuing its course, heading 192.” Derringer stated. Sharpe returned to the Corporal's shoulder. “Get the comms up.” Sharpe said sharply. “Already online sir.” Derringer handed Sharpe the microphone for FTL communications. “Attention unidentified Ship bearing 192, you are in restricted military space, state ident and proceed on bearing 280 out of the area.” Sharpe rattled off his command through the comm link, and gave the microphone back. “Get the bridge on the line, we may need to intercept.” Sharpe gave the order. Of the 16 people in the maon comms room, Derringer was just one of them. One of the other people, a sergeant he thought, started talking through a low range radio. “Has the ship responded?” Sharpe asked. “No sir.” Derringer said, watching the electro-acoustic signal. It remained steady as it was when the ship was first detected. “Find out what you can about the signal, I want this ship identified before we commit blue on blue.” Sharpe said. “Yes sir.” Derringer said, immediately opening up a database of known ship signals. Before he set his AI to search through the database, he started limiting the search. If he hadn’t, the AI would look through the database of every ship to ever go FTL since the first ship to officially do so. First, he limited it to ships of the United Federation of Inter-Planetary Systems. Then only to those within the Ubrisk star system, which he was in. He pressed search, and within a minute, the AI spat out ‘no result found’. Derringer removed the requirement for ships only within the starsystem, and went for Ship signals that were in a neighboring zone of conflict. The invasion of the Juran star system was three jumps away, and contained 4 zones of conflict. Finally, the AI had a hit. “Sir, I have a hit. UFS Jerimiah Holt. Sharpe was about to walk over when someone else piped up. “Sir that’s not possible, Holt was spaced five months ago, in the burbank system.” Someone outside of Derringers view said. “Check again and recheck.” Sharpe said. “I can if you want sir, but you’ll get the same result. A friend of mine was on that ship.” The unknown man said. Sharpe grumbled and returned to Derringers side. “Still no contact?” Sharpe asked. “No sir.” Derringer said. “We need to intercept, something’s not right. Get the bridge informed, need two interceptors, ship…4 and a half light minutes out?” Sharpe asked. “It hasn’t sped up or slowed down sir.” Derringer said. “Bridge has been filled in, they're launching hawks in five minutes with Hacksaws loaded.” One of the officers called out. Derringer kept his eyes on the blip while everyone around him started to scramble as it set in. 3 years with barely anything happening tends to make people either sluggish or skittish. “Ship using our own transponder signals? Smells bad to me.” He overheard one of the other officers say. Derringer noticed something on screen, however. He pulled up all pings of the ship since first detecting them, and found an interesting pattern. “New bearing, 201 horizontal, 019 vertical.” Derringer called out. “Is it changing course?” Sharpe asked. “No, it’s…drifting.” Derringer said. Since it was first detected, it had been moving away from its trajectory, as if it was slowly forcing itself to move in one direction. Suddenly, the blip turned into blips. “Multiple contacts identified.” Derringer said. “Is it launching anything!?” Sharpe asked immediately and loudly. The rest of the room quietened down, but kept talking to keep orders going. “It’s not launching anything, that thing is breaking \\*apart\\*.” Derringer said, watching the screen. All the blips that appeared were of completely different sizes and speeds, and some went backwards behind the main blip. The secondary blips were all less powerful than the main blip. “Sir, the Hawks are still two minutes out, but there’s a Gorilla drone, name Firehose that’s out on patrol, it's closer and we’re linking the call to its operators.” An officer said. After a few seconds the major picked up the microphone. “Drone Firehose, this is Comms Room 2, we need you to intercept an unknown infiltrator. Bogie’s at bearing 192, 019, 2 light minutes out.” Sharpe said succinctly. “Roger, changing course to intercept. ETI one minute.” Firehose said. “Lets hope its not some enemy vessel begging for repairs.” Sharpe said, watching the Electro-Acoustic Transponder screen with Derringer. Without warning, the screen started showing thousands upon thousands of blips showed up on screen, making Sharpe and Derringer recoil away for a moment. “Acoustics jammed.” Derringer said, watching the blips appear randomly throughout the entire range of the transponder. “It must be coming from the ship.” Derringer, before quickly using his interface to switch to Radar. “Taking snapshots.” Derringer said, sending pulses at where the ship should be by the time the radar waves intercept it. “This is firehose, we have visual. Transmitting info now.” Firehose said. “What the hell?” One of the officers said. “Whats wrong?” Sharpe said, going over to the officers workstation. “This ship is nothing Like I’ve seen before, and Derringer is right this thing is breaking apart.” The officer said. Derringer glanced over at the workstation. On it, was a very peculiar looking ship. It was clearly made of metal, but it was bulbous, and elongated. Not like a fuel transport with spherical cargo holds, but as if it has large oval growths on the ship. Regardless, it looked very solidly built. Except for the fact that it had a gigantic hole on the side with flame and smoke spewing out of it. Debris from the explosion was everywhere. “No ship name distinguishable on it, and that sure as shit doesn’t look like one of ours.” Sharpe said. “Hold on, I see something. Firehose, zoom in on the damage, left side of the crater.” The officer said. “Roger, adjusting.” Firehose said. The camera moved, and zoomed in on the left side of the giant hole. There appeared to be something on the side of the ship. Sparks were flying off the hull. The screen was too grainy to be certain, and too shaky to know. But some kind being was there performing repairs on the outside of the ship. “An EVA? At lightspeed??” Sharpe couldn’t contain his disbelief. “It could be a drone sir.” The officer said. Derringer was more focused on his Radar. The first few pulses produced results. The radar was able to bounce off surprisingly well. After the first few though, the radar started to get overloaded as the ship passed by the base. An alarm went off, its sound shrieking in the hallways. “Radiation?” The officer asked. “Firehose, can you get closer?” Sharpe asked. “Yes sir, adjusting course.” Firehose said. As firehose got closer and closer, the film got less grainy. The being performing repairs did not look human at all. “Definitely a drone.” The officer said. “And an advanced one, look at those appendages.” Sharpe pointed at the screen. The drone looked almost squid-like, with multiple limbs anchoring it down onto the ship while others seemed to be creating sparks along the ship's hull. “Ship has flown by.” Derringer said, watching it now travel away from the base. “Where the hell is it going?” Sharpe asked. “I don’t know sir, finding out now.” Derringer said, opening the acoustic transponder again. Now that it was facing in the complete opposite direction, it wasn’t being jammed anymore. “Sir, permission to change Acoustic Transponder direction toward Track 3421?” Derringer asked. Sharpe looked up, and around the room. “Permission granted.” Sharpe said. Derringer pressed a button on his interface, and slowly, the Enormous acoustic transponder started to rotate on the top of the starbase, to face behind it. The visual image of the ship and its worker kept getting more defined as firehose approached. Suddenly, it cut off, the film giving nothing but static. “Firehose, the visual camera has failed.” The officer said. “Negative, the entire drone has failed, Firehose has been destroyed.” Firehose communicated back. “Firehose, how is that possible?” Sharpe asked. “Sending package now.” Firehose said. A few inches later, a new video started playing. A thermal imaging camera was displaying the full ship, unzoomed in. The fire was burning the hottest, before something much hotter appeared for a split second on the side of the ship. For a fraction of a second, the spot stayed still, before growing exponentially towards the drone. The final frame was the entire screen glowing white hot. “That thing has guns.” Another officer said. “Acoustic transponder online.” Derringer said, the transponder now facing the right direction. Turning it back on, the transponder showed that the debris had spread out massively. Derringer immediately started calculations to estimate where it was going to show up. Taking into account that the fire was venting gas outwards and that it was already at a set speed. “Sir.” Derringer said. “What is it, corporal?” Sharpe said. “The ship is heading towards Gulfara Prime sir, and it's not slowing down.” Derringer said, tracing the path of the ship all the way to the populated planet. Sharpe, and most everyone looked up at him. “Alright. Alert the Gulfara station that a rogue ship is out of control and heading its way. Alert command that we have an out of control warship heading into a civilian sector.” Sharpe said. Everyone started moving quickly, and the radiation alarm subsided as the ship moved further away from them. “God damnit, 5 months from retirement and this shit happens.” Major Sharpe said. —--------------------------------------------------------- John was sitting down on a park bench, breathing in the air carefully. “I know this isn’t what you wanted.” Sarah said to his right. “Oh you know, do you?” He asked. “It's what’s best for her.” She said. “No, it’s what's best for you. And look at him.” John said, gesturing with his hand towards the playground in front of him. Jessica was among the kids playing around the bars and slides. Sarah’s husband was squatting at the edge, and talking to Jessica. Jessica was stone faced while talking to him. “Just because she hasn’t warmed up to Jack doesn’t mean he’s a bad guy.” Sarah said, as if she had said it a hundred times before. “Besides, it’s not like you care. You’d rather go on another tour than deal with your own family.” Sarah said, scoffing. “They need me. And she knows they need me. I thought I could trust you with her, but apparently not!” John said, folding his arms. “You don’t ‘trust’ her with me, you dump her on me, and then fuck off to the army!” Sarah said. “You. Took her. To a factory. Instead of hiring a babysitter. See that giant gap of air where her pinkie finger used to be?” John pointed at Jessica. “Yeah, that’s your fault.” John said. “You disgust me. And don’t raise your voice. Don’t want the last memory of your daughter to be anything bad, do you?” Sarah asked. John just stared daggers at her. “Daddy!” Jessica said. John’s attention immediately snapped to the 7 year old running up to him. Jack was walking after her, with a half smirk on his face. “Hey jess. How’s it going?” John asked. “Good. Mommy and Jack are taking me to Circe’s for lunch.” Jessica said. “Oh. Really?” John said, giving Sarah a side eye. “That greasy place?” He asked. “Hey, its really good.” Jessica said, fake pouting. “I’m sure it is.” John said. “You can get that double burger you always like.” Jessica said. “...” John looked at Sarah, and then back to Jessica. “..I’m sorry sweetie, but I can’t come.” John said. “Why not? You love that place!” She said. “Mmm, no, I like home cooked stuff more. But I’m…not invited to come.” John said. “Oh. Well, I invite you.” Jessica said. “Sorry but, adults have to invite adults.” John said. “Well, Mommy, invite him.” Jessica said. “No can do, Jessica. He’s not really welcome anymore.” Sarah said, standing up. “...Did you beat up the cashier again?” Jessica gave John her own side eye. “He wasn’t a cashier, he was a robber, and no. I’m just not invited.” John said. “Come on, I’ll get you that double burger.” Jack said, putting his hand on Jessica’s shoulder. “But that’s Dad’s burger.” She said. She looked sad and disappointed with her mouth open. “Then we’ll get you yours. Come on, it’s time to go.” Sarah said, putting her arm behind Jessica and slowly pulling her away. The three walked away from John, down the gravel path. She looked behind her, and found John looking at her as she walked away. She waved. “By daddy!” She called out. He waved back, and Sarah turned Jessica’s head away to focus on the path in front of them. As they faded away, walking out of the park, John rubbed his face and buried his head in his hands, taking a huge breath out. He stayed still for a bit, before his phone started to vibrate and ring, he ignored it for a second, before realizing that it wasn’t his normal ring tone. He brought it out of the pocket and realized what it was. //EMERGENCY ALERT REGIONAL ALERT THIS IS NOT A TEST, A starship has fallen from orbit and will impact near the following cities in approximately 5 minutes: Calgura, Bromide Industrial Zone, and Calgura Interplanetary Elevator. Seek shelter immediately. Radiation contamination is likely. Do not evacuate. Impact zone is in Calgura National Forest. EMERGENCY ALERT// He read and reread the alert, and looked up to see that the parents had grabbed their kids, and immediately started to rush out of the park. He looked back, and found that Jessica and his ex wife had disappeared, as did Jack. He shook nervously for a bit. But breathed carefully, and leaned back, watching the sky. There were a few trees around, with their red leaves slowly falling down. He decided not to hide or shelter, not seeing the point of doing so. He breathed in and out slowly, thinking about what led up to this. He spent minutes trying to think. The absolute silence, with the gentle shaking of tree leaves, and the odd sound of a bird every once and a while stopped him from thinking too much. Finally, he saw it. It was an extremely odd looking ship, looking more grown than made. It was facing backwards, and using its main thrusters to slow down. Of a cluster of engines it had at the back, only around half were functioning, with some cutting out and turning back on every fraction of a second. A giant gaping hole was in the side of it as it fell. It leveled out, and tried its hardest to slow down. It disappeared behind some buildings, and John felt the ground rumble, and heard it crash. Finally shaken out of his stupor, he got up, and started running. He got out of the park, and to his car, where he started it up, and started driving. People started to emerge from the buildings as he drove past them, breaking the speed limit as he went. He was about to pass an intersection when he slammed on the brakes. A military convoy immediately raced past. He waited till the very end, before pulling out and following it. He followed it to the very edge of the city, where a small checkpoint was made, he was flagged down, and he stopped. “Sir, you have to turn around now.” One of the guards approached him. “Look, I’m military, Sergeant John Kneel. My convoy just got through.” John tried to explain. “You’re a sergeant? Got any id?” The guard asked. “Yeah.” John said, reaching for his wallet and pulling it out carefully and giving it to the guard. “I figured, you know, a massive crash, it’s probably all hands on deck.” John said. The guard inspected it and looked at him. “Yes it is. What’s your battalion?” He asked. “2601st. Rangers.” John said. “2601st? Alright look, command has no idea what’s going on, if it's ours or some other nations. Right now we’re trying to inspect the damage and cordon off the area so no one tries to take anything they shouldn’t.” The guard said, handing the id back to John. “And stopping people like you from charging in and being a hero.” The guard said. “Look, just radio my CO, he was probably on the convoy just before me.” John said. The guard looked between you and the crash site. “Alright, just go through, I’ll radio him now.” The guards said, stepping away from the vehicle, and waved his arms to let John through. John obliged, and started driving again. It took a bit, but he caught up to the convoy. It eventually pulled over onto the side of the roadway, where there was a clearing in the forest. John got out, and soon found his CO barreling towards him like a drill sergeant on a death march. “AND WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING BACK HERE?” Brooks said to John. “Sir I-” “You are on strict shore leave son! Are you deaf!?” Brooks yelled. “Sir no sir!” John shouted back. “Have you lost your mind!? Cause I will help you find it!” Brooks said. “Sir, a ship crashed several miles away sir! I figured you needed my help sir!” John said. “You are a goddamn sergeant! You are not a Colonel! You are not a General! Why would we need you!?” Brooks yelled. While John and Brooks yelled at each other, the rest of the battalion was unloading the trucks. Supplies, food, radiation equipment, weapons. “Sir, because everyone is needed in the army!” John said. “Wrong, everyone is needed in the Marines! The army is where the best go! Especially the rangers!” Brooks yelled. “Go get your god damn equipment on, and get ready for the clean up detail you fucking waste of oxygen!” Brooks yelled. John saluted him, and Brooks saluted back, with John rushing off with the rest of the battalion. “I was wondering when the fuck you’d come back.” Paul said as John approached him. Paul was a rather skinny man, with mutton chops for sideburns and a mustache to connect them. Paul had just unloaded a crate of radiation equipment onto the ground, and was now standing in the truck bed. “Well, got nothing else going on.” John said, Paul helping John up onto the truck bed. “You know what the hell just crashed down there?” Paul asked, grabbing one end of a massive box. “Saw it, looked weird. Not ours I don’t think.” John said, grabbing the other end. “Obviously, or they wouldn’t send us.” Paul said while straining. The two of them lifted up the box, and threw it off the truck. “How’s divorced life treating you?” Paul asked, jumping off the truck while John got down slowly. “Not now man.” John said, as they resumed carrying the box. “Ah, still sore. Well when this is over we’ll hit a bar.” Paul said. The two of them carried the box next to the radiation equipment. Beyond them, further into the clearing, the rest of the battalion was setting up shop. Tents were being propped up, and sand filled barriers were being put in place. “Why are we deploying here, isn’t the crash still a while away?” John asked as he looked out to the rest of the base. “Commander's orders. We set up shop here, get our asses ready for firefighting duty, and then we start running to seal up the reactor leak.” Paul said. “Reactor leak? Just great, I know for a fact that the cancer treatment is gonna suck like a bi-” “KNEEL! GET YOUR ASS IN UNIFORM NOW!” Brooks yelled from across the convoy. “Go on, start getting dressed. I won’t laugh at your dick I swear.” Paul said while turning around to get more stuff off the truck. John delved into the radiation equipment, and started putting on the suit. It was designed to stop enough radiation from killing the cells of a person, guaranteeing that at the most, they would get cancer. As John peeled off his clothes to get dressed, he received at least a few whistles from the people that saw him. Eventually, he was fully suited up. The shiny reflective silver lining of the suit made him glisten in the red sunlight. “I hate these things.” John said, as he put on the oxygen mask. It could recycle oxygen from the air around it, and use a lead filter to stop radiation from getting through. It also felt like it was at least partially strangling him every second. “Yeah well, maybe next time a ship won’t crash on our planet then.” Paul said. As John put the finishing touches on the suit, several gunshots rang out from the forest, closer to the shipwreck. “Aw hell.” Paul said. “All essential personnel remain with the firebase, everyone else, back on the convoy!” Brooks' voice crackled through the radio. “Come on, up you get.” Paul said, giving out a hand for John. “Nah nah nah, you get your ass in a rad suit before you come along.” John said, gesturing for Paul to get off the truck. “Well, if you say so, sergeant.” Paul said, giving him a lazy salute before getting off the truck. John moved away, and got onto a different truck, one that already had soldiers on it.while Paul started putting his suit on. The convoy started up before Paul could put his suit back on. Most of the trucks started moving again, leaving behind the trucks that had the base supplies. “Where’s your gun?” One of the other soldiers asked. “Right now? Probably back at the firebase, but I didn’t have time to get it.” John said. Every other soldier groaned. “Why the fuck would you leave your gun?” Another spoke up. “Listen….Gondala? Fucked up name, I was on shore leave less than an hour ago when a starship fell out of the fucking sky.” John said, leaning forward to read Gondala’s name tag. “Well too fucking bad.” Gondala said. “Hey, hey! We’re all pissed off that we had our vacations cut short. You, Kneel, what’s your role?” The soldier asked. “EOD and Mechanic sir.” John replied, noting the staff sergeant insignia on his shoulder. “With all due respect sir what are you doing out here? Shouldn’t you be back at base?” John asked. “I could ask why you're not with your squad.” The staff sergeant asked. “Well, I think most of them are back at the base helping build the damn thing.” John said. “Heh. And yet you have the balls to get on without a gun.” The staff sergeant said. “Looks that way sir.” John said. “Names Cost. You know how to use a machine gun Sergeant?” Staff Sergeant Cost asked. “Yes sir.” John said, nodding. “Alright, get on the 50 cal above, we’re probably gonna need it.” Cost said. “Yes sir.” John said, getting up and moving over to the turret mount. The other soldiers had to shuffle to let John through. John poked his head out and got onto the main gun of the truck. The water cooled machine gun was heavy and difficult to aim, but it being mounted to the truck meant recoil was no issue, and whatever he would be aiming at would simply cease to exist once he held down the trigger. The convoy moved slowly down an asphalt road, as the plume of smoke in the distance slowly grew. Looking down at his firearm, a small screen indicated the ambient radiation, which was slowly increasing. The convoy stopped as he was looking down. Looking back up, the asphalt road ended, with dirt and burnt trees now covering the road. “What’s going on up there?” Cost asked through the radio. “We’ve reached the trail of the crash site, the convoy is splitting up.” John replied. The trucks in front of him started to move slower, as the convoy broke apart, and started approaching the wreck by themselves. The distant gunfire was sporadic, and the radios were starting to malfunction as the ambient radiation levels increased. The ship came into view as John's truck broke off from the convoy and started driving towards it. It was impressively large. Larger than most hydrogen transport ships. The ship itself was listing slightly onto its undamaged side. It appears that when it crashed engines first, it rotated on its belly while the ship slid across the ground, meaning that the damaged side of the ship was facing John. In the distance, he could see a scout pick-up near the ship. The ground around the ship was filled with pot holes and craters. “What do—----see?” Cost used the radio, his question barely understandable. “I see the ship and a pickup near it! No idea what they're firing at!” John yelled out over the sound of the engine, instead of using the radio. As the convoy started to approach, the radios became useless, and the trucks pulled up behind the pick up. “Hey! What the fucks going on!?” John yelled to one of the gunner of the pickup. “The drones! They’re stealing!” The one in front of him said. “What!?” John yelled. The soldiers that the trucks were carrying started to disembark. Suddenly, the pickup gunner opened fire. Looking at where his bullets were aiming, he saw what the gunner meant at last. A large drone, one with that looked startlingly biological, was flying towards the formation. It looked more like a squid than a machine, with multiple appendages attached to the bottom of the machine. It was unmistakably robotic though, as no human could ever fit in it. The bullets the gunner was firing missed for the first few seconds, before several found its mark, scoring direct hits on the spear like main body. The drone went down, falling over itself multiple times before rolling to a stop. Somehow, it wasn’t enough, and got up, using its appendages to slink away from the group of trucks, back towards the damaged ship. “What the fuck was that thing?” Gondala asked. “I don’t know.” Cost said, moving beside the pickup. “Was it like, a combat drone, or something?” Gondola asked. “I didn’t know five seconds ago, and I don’t know now. You, whose in charge here?” Cost asked the gunner. “Me. The other pick up got stolen, and as you can see, the driver's dead.” The gunner said. John couldn’t see it because he was behind the pickup, but the front end was battered, a dead soldier lying in the driver's seat. “What do you mean it got stolen?” Cost asked. “Three of those drones came to steal the pick ups. Two carried away the other pick up, while one tried to take this one. It killed my driver but I managed to pump some holes into it. It ran off before I could put it down. And now more are coming.” The gunner said. He was clearly scared. “Alright, keep your eyes peeled. Jameson, you get your truck out of the radiation zone, tell command that we have hostiles.” Cost said. Another soldier saluted, and got back into a truck, and started driving it away from the wreck. “Everyone else, spread out, and stick close to the trucks. The air force will be here any minute, and we can clear out these drones.” Cost said. “Incoming!” The gunner shouted, turning his gun to face the enemy. A group of around eight drones emerged from the ship, and started flying towards the trucks. Luckily, John had already trained his gun on one of the openings of the ship. The same opening the drones were emerging from. John lined up his shot at the drones, which were flying in an extremely straight line. “Permission to open fire?” John yelled. “Fire fire!” Cost yelled, the soldier taking up defensive positions. John immediately let out a burst of bullets. Unlike the pick up, which had a light machine gun as its armament, the 50 cal chugged along, spitting out far larger bullets. It had a slow rate of fire, and most of the bullets missed, but when a single bullet connected with a drone, an audible pop was heard, and it sent the drone spiraling into the ground, where it rested. Only two drones were down when the rest of the team opened fire. The drones started dropping like flies, but not before two managed to get past the firing line. The pick up gunner jumped off the truck, while the two drones, which were longer than the truck itself, grabbed onto it. Their grip compacted where their tentacles touched, and they just picked up the truck and flew away. Small arms fire destroyed one of the drones, but the remaining drone was strong enough to carrying the truck back to the ship. “Hold fire, Hold fire!” Cost said, after which most of the guns fell silent. “We need to conserve ammo in case they come back!” Cost yelled. “Sir, they're ripping apart that pick up!” Gondola yelled. Gondola was aiming down the sights of his rifle, looking at the ship. Cost reached into a truck, and pulled out binoculars. “What are they doing?” Cost muttered, and he brought them up to his face, and looked out to the ship. “What, what is it?” John asked, keeping his gun aimed in the general direction of the ship. “They are…welding the pickup to the ship. “What, as a trophy?” John asked. “No, no. They’re using it to repair the ship. They’re patching up the reactor leak.” Cost said, lowering the binoculars. Afterword: I have never written so much in one day. I had an idea, and figured it was good enough. Will I continue it? Judging by my track record, the answer is yes but actually know. Just in case; [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1ewm22z/colonists_on_a_deathworld_pt2/)",

          "selftext": "I work at an HCA hospital making $30.7 as a full time staff nurse in the ICU. Staffing is terrible and I’m tripled about every 3rd shift. I’m over it. Everyone is leaving for better offers. I have ONE YEAR of experience and I’m about to be one of the most experienced nurses on the floor. The unsafe ratio and 3 to 4 triples daily for a 20 bed ICU is terrifying. There is no end in sight. I talked to my director and her projection for us being fully staffed is August. I went to a job fair at a ratio mandated hospital. It was packed because they pay well and are safe. I interviewed with two ICUs but they are so competitive and only have night shift positions. I interviewed with the float pool and was called today and was offered $35.50 for a med surg day shift float pool (1 to 4 ratio) with a $20k retention bonus paid out over 3 years. I think I’m going to do it but I’m nervous. I was / am possibly thinking about CRNA school but we also want to have kids this year and I just can’t stay where I’m at in my current ICU environment. This is the great thing about nursing, right? You can do lots of different things with it! I am planning on staying PRN in the ICU. I just took SLED and Prismax classes so I would like to do my shadow shifts and be signed off on these devices. I also just took my CCRN and passed! So I don’t want to close the door on the ICU but I also have boundaries and refuse to work full time in such an unsafe environment. I’ll be getting a $15k raise and be working for the safest hospital in town. Thoughts? Seems like a no brainer to me. I’m just a lil scared about doing something completely new but also empowered! One of my coworkers tonight said that I was “too smart” to go work med surg float pool. So rude. All nursing is good nursing - esp safe nursing!! UPDATE 3/30: I’m taking the job! Going to ask for $39 an hour. Also completely forgot the option of getting my DNP 🤦🏼‍♀️ That feels much more realistic for me at this point if I want to pursue higher education. TBH I loveeee being a bedside nurse. As long as I’m paid fairly and treated well I could see myself doing my whole career at bedside!",

          "selftext": "If you’re a Tandem Mobi insulin pump user, you need to be aware of a serious and potentially life-threatening malfunction that can leave you stranded without insulin. This is not just a minor glitch—it’s a critical failure that could put lives at risk. The Malfunction: What Happens? For seemingly no apparent reason, the pump will begin beeping and vibrating every five minutes, alerting you that something is wrong. The lights on the pump will flash red continuously or possibly stay solid, indicating a total system failure. When this happens: • All insulin delivery stops immediately—both basal insulin and bolus doses cannot be administered. • You cannot silence the alarms or dismiss the error. • The pump will not restart without specific steps that require equipment you likely don’t have on you while away from home. This means that if you are out for the day, at work, traveling, or even just a few hours from home without backup insulin, you’re in serious trouble. High blood sugar, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), and hospitalization become real risks. Restarting the Pump: A Frustrating Process The only way to fix this issue is to: 1. Place the pump on its charging pad. 2. Hold the Quick Bolus button for about 30 seconds until it turns off. 3. Ensure the pump has a proper connection with the charger—it will vibrate slightly when aligned correctly. 4. Wait 1-2 minutes for it to restart. But here’s the problem: Who carries a charging pad with them everywhere? When you’re out for the day, you don’t expect your life-saving medical device to completely shut down, requiring a bulky charger to restart. Tandem’s response? Just carry a backup insulin plan. Tandem’s Response: Do They Even Care? When reporting this issue to Tandem Diabetes Care, their response was shockingly dismissive. Their policy states: • If the malfunction happens three times, they will replace the pump. • However, the replacement is likely a refurbished unit, which could have its own issues. • Customer service representatives offer no real solution beyond telling users to carry backup insulin. This should not be happening with a life-sustaining medical device. The entire purpose of an insulin pump is to reduce the burden of diabetes management—not to leave users stranded without insulin in a dangerous medical emergency. A Widespread Issue? It’s unclear how many people are experiencing these failures, but reports are appearing across online communities. Reddit, diabetes forums, and social media are full of users encountering similar issues, receiving the same inadequate response from Tandem. If this is happening to you, it’s critical to report it so that regulators and advocacy groups take action. What Can Be Done? If you experience this issue, here’s what you should do: 1. Report the malfunction to Tandem—even if they don’t seem to care, having records of complaints matters. 2. File a complaint with the FDA’s MedWatch program (FDA MedWatch)—this is how device failures get officially documented. 3. Contact diabetes advocacy groups like JDRF, the American Diabetes Association, or Beyond Type 1 to raise awareness. 4. Warn others in the diabetes community about this issue so they can be prepared. 5. Consider switching to a different insulin pump brand—companies with better reliability and customer service exist. Final Thoughts: This Should NOT Be Happening Tandem’s insulin pumps are marketed as advanced, reliable medical devices, yet they are failing at a basic level—providing uninterrupted insulin delivery. When failure occurs, users are left without immediate solutions and a customer service team that downplays the seriousness of the issue. If you rely on a Tandem Mobi insulin pump, be prepared. Bring a backup insulin plan, carry a charging pad if possible, and document any malfunctions. Most importantly, demand better from Tandem and the FDA—because no one with diabetes should have to fight for their safety against the very devices meant to keep them alive.",

Is there a really fast way to obtain an insulin pump? Possibly a used database of old pumps for an affordable price? I am inquiring about ordering a new pump from Tandem, but I’m not sure what the insurance coverage and cost is going to look like. The Tandem rep also said that ordering a brand new pump does have several steps involved and it does take awhile to actually receive the pump. Any tips would be greatly appreciated!",

So I bought omnipod dash in Australia without insurance and even paid a lot of money for shipping and taxes. But yesterday the site doubled the omnipod price and I'm very depressed. Previously, I paid about 165.85 dollars for a box. When I bought 3 boxes, I paid about 578.45 dollars for taxes and shipping. But now everything is double 🥲 So I found one site after searching and I want to know if it's a reliable site, although this might be a rude question. Also, could you tell me if there is a site where I can buy omnipod dash other than this one? Thank you for all the help. https://nationalpharmacyhelper.com/products/omnipod-dash-pods-10-pack-dash And I apologize if this question is a violation of the regulations.",

I usually don’t have an issue with this company, but I got a 10 pack instead of 5 this time and I’m suspicious they didn’t send me the correct pods. I need DASH pods, but don’t have any old sets to compare to the ones I got. Is there a physical way to tell an original Omnipod set from a DASH? No where on the box or individual package does it say DASH, just “Omnipod”, and the tab on the pod is clear, not blue (I think that’s how we tell?). I definitely ordered a box of dash pods (says so on the receipt) and I just need to make sure before I get them exchanged. TIA!",

It'll be easy to do while she's at home, but I've been trying to figure out how this is going to work while she's at school. She's way too young to do things by herself, and I really don't trust the teachers/\"school nurse\" for this, even with a 504. Call me over-protective, but when the \"diabetes nurse\" that was assigned to my daughter came to the school to educate the staff on things, and we had to explain to that nurse what ketones were, it just makes me a little uneasy to put my kid's life in their hands is all. So, for the parents that use Omnipod Dash, and have young kids that can't manage things themselves, what do you do while your kid is at school? And for those with Omnipod 5, yes, I know it's a lot better, and I wish we could use it, but because of the red tape, we can't. Looping in the near future, but for now, the lesser Dash that is missing features like Automated Insulin Delivery, CGM Integration, and Smartphone Control will have to do.",

We know from Varacek \"fireside\" end of FEB that there were 5 locations thru IRB process--another 8 locations in various phase of IRB process--and another approx 25 more sites that SeaStar is engaged with ( @ 15 mins mark here--https://s201.q4cdn.com/298572669/files/doc\\_events/2025/Feb/27/SeaStar-Fireside-Chat-2.mp4 ) This is the U S News ranking of Pediatric nephrology hospitals --https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals/pediatric-rankings/nephrology Per SeaStar , 10 of the top 50 hospitals have prior experience with Quelimmune \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ So some of the known unknown \\#1--What is the # of treated patients/data that will allow the registry decouple process to happen this year?? (this is 1 of SeaStar 2025 goals) \\#2--IF the top 50 PED hospitals (220 PED hosp in U S) treat 50% of PED-AKI--is that somewhat linear and top 25 hosp treat 25% of PED-AKI?? IF that is the case then top 25 hosp would be treating approx 1,000 patients per year. This should be 20+ million $$ per year ( @ 20,000$$ per patient) \\#3--When a location such as Texas Childrens/Houston is added--does that incl all their locations ??--they have a Austin,TX branch also. Or is that sep IRB by health system or sep IRB by state law or another factor?? \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_ SeaStar pretty much hits their goals. Some have not been \"timely\" but steps have been methodical So for 2025 the \"20 hospital systems\" shown here should be hopefully closer to 25 and the adult trial full enrollment is maybe still on DEC track with todays 119 of 200 update https://preview.redd.it/fnakp4e4w9df1.png?width=550&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef9afcede17e25414146e88d93c624db51539f8b",

          "selftext": "This happened about 12 months ago. I am a nurse and work in a relatively specialised field. Due to previous financial difficulties, I had taken on a number of additional jobs in the previous few years and had settled on one that was particularly good for me - I was employed casually in a smaller six-bedded unit in a private hospital. Because of the nature of my specialty, this particular area required two nurses in attendance at all times. 2 nurses to 6 patients is a dream ratio and virtually unheard of in private health. To combat this, most hospitals that have beds for this particular specialty area combine them with another ward so that they can staff us down and allow the regular nurses to cover us. However, for some reason, this hospital had located the beds completely separate to any other unit. This meant they had no choice to safely staff us but to roster two nurses on at all times, and our manager stood her ground and refused to budge on that requirement. Because I was casually employed, there was always the possibility that my hours could be cut or shifts cancelled at any time. However, because they needed both nurses present at all times, they could not do that. Even if we had no patients in this particular specialty area, they had to keep two nurses available in case we needed to admit. If we had no patients at all some nurses would go on call, but because I relied on public transport / bicycle commuting to get to work, my manager understood that I could not go on call because I could not return to the workplace in a reasonable time, and instead I would be sent to help out in other areas. Our manager had, in addition to her other duties, become the project lead on a large expansion within our facility, and had performed very well in the role. So well, in fact, that when another facility under the same company was expanding, she was headhunted to lead their expansion project as well. She was compelled to a secondment that would require her to live out of state for several months, and as a result, we would be given a new acting manager. To our dismay, we discovered that the acting manager was from a ward where it was well known that the staff could not stand her. Sure enough, within days, she began doing things like cancelling our staff and moving her surplus staff into our area when she was low on numbers and overstaffed, costing them to us, even though they lacked the appropriate training and experience to work in our area. Anything to make her budget look better, which at the same time made our budget look worse. It all came to a head one morning when, after two hours of a 12 hour shift, we discharged our last patient. I was literally on the phone finalising the patient discharge when our acting manager called the other nurse on the shift and instructed both of us to clock out immediately and go on call. Confused, I rang her back. Me: \"Hi AM, it's schmickers. I just got a message saying that you want us to clock out and go home. You may not be aware, although our previous manager was, but I take public transport to and from work. I can't be on call.\" AM: \"That doesn't matter. You have no patients. I can't pay for you to be on the ward doing nothing and no other areas require help today. I need you to clock off and go home.\" Me: \"Are you sure? We are half way through checking the emergency trolley, there is a massive pile of follow-up calls to make and we haven't even stripped the patient room yet.\" AM: \"That doesn't matter. Bring me your phone and keys and clock off.\" Me: \"What are you going to do if there is an admission? It will take me over an hour to get back.\" AM: \"Well I'll sit there until you can get back.\" I was fuming. The other nurse began re-sealing the emergency trolley and I stopped her. We had been instructed to leave, and leave we would! I marched the phone and keys to our acting manager and handed them over. As I did so, she said: \"You can't be paid to sit and make phone calls. That has to be done when you have patients.\" I replied: \"We are busy with the patients when we have patients. Besides, it's only just past 9am, and most of the follow-up calls are to families with children who are busy doing school runs. _I_ wouldn't answer a call from an unknown number before 9am.\" I handed the keys over, clocked off, and began the journey home. I hadn't reached home before I got a message from my OTHER workplace, asking for a nurse for the night shift and offering an overtime payment. Now, I was booked for a day shift at my second job the next day, and I knew we had no theatre cases booked, which meant the likelihood of THAT shift being cancelled was also high. I couldn't afford to sit at home waiting for work if we didn't have patients, but just to be sure, I gave the union a quick call, and they managed to illuminate something wonderful. *As a casual employee, I was not entitled to be on call at all.* That meant not only could they not ask me to be on call, I was not entitled to the measly $26 allowance that permanent employees received. As soon as I had clocked out, my shift had *ended*. Armed with that knowledge, I rang my acting manager and informed her that I had been offered paying work that night, and as a consequence, would need to cancel my shift the following day. She was quite hostile, asking: \"Do you *normally* cancel work here to work elsewhere?\" I replied: \"I don't *normally* have my shifts cancelled at all, but I am not a charity and cannot sit at home unpaid when I could be paid to work elsewhere. I have a family to support.\" After this call, I sent a quick email to my usual manager, outlining the acting manager's request and why I had left the ward disorganised, the emergency trolley unsealed, and a stack of work not done, and went to bed to have a nap. I was awoken at approximately 1615 in the afternoon by my wife, looking confused. My acting manager had rung and left a message with her that we were admitting a patient and she required me back at work. I was bemused - the acting manager should not even have been there at that time of the afternoon, and clearly lacked the stones to talk to me directly. No matter. I rang the hospital supervisor. Me: \"Hi, it's Schmickers. I just got a message via my wife that I'm a bit confused about. Apparently there is a patient, and you want me to come in to work for a shift?\" Supervisor: \"That's right, we're admitting to your area. We need you back in.\" Me: \"You know my shift was cancelled, right?\" Supervisor: \"AM told me you were on call?\" Me: \"Well, I can't be on call, I'm a casual employee. My shift was cancelled. Besides, by the time I've dressed, packed, got on my bicycle, ridden half an hour to my nearest train station, caught the train, changed to a tram, then walked the rest of the way, then showered and changed it'll be,\" (quick check of the time) \"1830. My shift was meant to end at 1930. I don't think I'm going to be much help to you.\" I heard the sound of the phone being covered, and a muffled voice, before shouting and ranting began in the background. It was my acting manager, still clearly there and clutching her pearls about how unreasonable it was that it would take two hours for me to return to work. As the ranting continued, I spoke on the phone again. \"Supervisor, it's Schmickers. I know you have AM shouting at you in the background, but right now I'm the person you need to be listening too, because *I* called *you*. AM is well aware of how long it takes me to return to work, because I told her this morning. She knew when she asked me to clock off that I would not be returning to work. I'm sorry she gave you the impression that I could be on call, but I cannot. Now, as I am not able to assist you any further and I am not on the clock, I will be ending this conversation.\" And I put the phone down. I got a couple of confused texts about why I wasn't working the next day and WTF had happened on the ward from the night staff when they arrived and began re-sealing the emergency trolley and arranging for after hours bed cleans. I had a week off after that. Unfortunately this particular manager appears to be teflon coated, but I've never had a shift cancelled since.",

          "selftext": "&gt;According to the lawsuit, the terms of that agreement prohibited Krafton from firing any of the founders without cause or interfering in the studio’s business in any way that might impact that payout. Unknown Worlds would “maintain operational control of the Group companies in all material respects, including (for both existing and new products) product roadmap, launch, planning, partnering, budgeting and employee matters” as long as at least one of the cofounders remained employed there. &gt;The founders claim the business relationship didn’t begin going south until earlier this year when projections for *Subnautica 2*'s sales were shared with Krafton management, one of which showed them hitting the targets required for the $250 million payout. “During the first week of April 2025, Unknown Worlds’ publishing colleagues in Krafton’s El Segundo, California office traveled to Korea to finalize the marketing and advertising strategy for *Subnautica 2*’s launch,” the lawsuit reads. “Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.” &gt;Things came to a head in a May 2025 milestone review, portions of which leaked online last week, in which Krafton argued the game needed more content and development time against the recommendation of the founders. From there, the founders alleged that Krafton began trying to sabotage the launch by locking down all publishing resources, failing to respond to emails with third-party partners, and claiming control over the final release date decision. &gt;“One of Krafton’s El Segundo publishing employees reported to Gill that Krafton Headquarters told all Krafton teams to stop all creative tasks related to *Subnautica 2*,” the lawsuit reads. “The employee’s supervisor even demanded that he and his team cease communication with Unknown Worlds altogether.” &gt;Then in June, according to the lawsuit, Krafton tried to get Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill to take a lower payout while also claiming that the founders were failing in their contractual obligations to the company. “On June 25, 2025, Krafton’s Head of Corporate Development told Gill that Krafton’s plan was to remove the Unknown Worlds board and fire the Founders,” the lawsuit reads. &gt;“She warned Gill that ‘the lawyers are ready to go.’” They were fired roughly a week later, with termination letters from Striking Distance Studios CEO Steve Papoutsis, who has since taken over Unknown Worlds, blaming the founders’ “intention to proceed with a premature release of *Subnautica 2*.” According to the lawsuit, the firings were made “without cause,” and Krafton even went so far as to offer them their “post-termination payments and benefits” for being terminated “without cause.”",

          "selftext": "Seppo Antero Boisman and Nils Wilhelm Gustafsson had both been inseparably close friends since they were 12 years old and often spent the nights at each other's houses and both became electricians after graduating from school. In May of 1960, Seppo now 18, began dating a girl, 15-year-old Anja Tuulikki Mäki. Around the same time, Nils began dating another 15-year-old named Maila Irmeli Björklund. Two weeks after Nils's birthday, [the four](https://imgur.com/jxggl6L) decided to go camping near Lake Bodom outside of Espoo located in Finland's Uusimaa Region. Maila was excited for the upcoming holidays and her first summer without having to care for her younger brothers. Although Seppo and Nils's parents saw them as reliable and trusted them, Maila and Anja's parents were reluctant to let them go camping alone as they saw it was unsafe and only agreed after relentless begging. The campsite was a 30-minute drive from their home in Helsinki. They arrived on June 4, 1960, and Seppo got to work borrowing a canvas tent, brought fishing gear, a few knives, pliers, two bottles of strong liquor and a dozen light beers from home. Nils bought bread, sausages and snacks. In the afternoon the Seppo and Nils borrowed two motorcycles which they used to drive them and Anja and Maila to the campsite. The four set up on the south shore of the lake where they found a satisfactory camping spot on a small peninsula. Only a few steps away from the beach. Their camping spot was noted for being in a safe and private location. Seppo and Nils not long after, dropped off their backpacks and reboarded their motorcycles and drove back to the campsite canteen one kilometer away from their campsite. They purchased a few packs of chewing gum and bottles of soda to mix with wine. By the time they returned to the campsite, it was already 7:15 p.m. and thus not many people were outside anymore. The last thing known about what they were doing was how they set up their single tent which could barely fit all four people leaving it quite crowded. Early the next morning on June 5, two young people were going for a stroll alongside the south shore of Lake Bodom. It was nearly 6:00 a.m. when they heard the sound of someone moving and found higher ground to try and locate the source of the sound. There, the two found two motorcycles leaning against a birch tree. They also found a partially collapsed tent. On the tent was a man lying on the tent. His face could not be clearly seen and could only note that he was wearing dark trousers. Later, they saw another man walking away from the tent and into the woods. The two again, couldn't make out his face and only saw that he was wearing a light-coloured shirt. The man entered the woods and later disappeared. The two wanted to get a closer look at the motorcycles but left so as to not disturb their fellow campers. Around the same time a 14-year-old boy named Olavi Kivilahti, was sitting by the rocks near the lake waiting for those he was fishing with to return. While waiting he noticed a young man about 20 years old of average height, with brown hair combed back, wearing a light-coloured shirt and dark trousers walking out of the forest. He then walked southward and disappeared from his view. By 10:00 a.m. more and more campers were waking up leading to the tent being noticed by many more. A group of teenagers swimming in the lake nearby to the campsite saw the tent collapsed with a man lying on top of it. They assumed there was a fight going on between campers and decided they didn't want to get involved. At 11:15 a.m. a passerby saw the same man lying on the tent and he would be the one to finally take action. He ran towards a nearby construction site to use a public phone to call the police. The local police accompanied by detectives arrived. The man lying on top of the tent was Nils. Nils had been heavily beaten as his face was swollen including his eyes swollen shut. Nils also suffered several fractures to the left side of his jaw, cheekbone and temple. Other injuries consisted of stab wounds to his left forearm and right face, and a stab wound to his cheek that completely cut through the muscle exposing his teeth. [The police looked inside the tent](https://imgur.com/7m58Ypv) and [found the other three campers](https://imgur.com/LYq2T26). Seppo was lying on the edge of the tent near the entrance with his hands placed on his chest. He had been struck several times on the chin and face with a blunt object with several fractures to his skull. Furthermore, he had been stabbed multiple times through the tent canvas with two fatal wounds to his neck and chest. Anja was found curled up, face down with her shirt pulled up over her head. She had suffered several blunt force wounds to her head resulting in skull fractures. Lastly, Maila was lying near the tent of the curtain her left leg was parallel to Anja's back, and her right leg was bent on Anja's head. Maila's shirt was pulled up to her shoulders and her jeans pulled down toward her knees. She had suffered three blunt force wounds to her head resulting in fractures to her skull and jaw causing severe brain swelling and intracranial bleeding. Lastly, she had suffered 15 stab wounds to her neck and shoulders. Nils was miraculously still alive and rushed to hospital. The police believed that the killer first cut the drawstring and left the canvas of the tent alone so he could easily see the heads of the campers to strike with them being trapped and unable to escape under the tent and that they wouldn't be able to see their attacker. The police collected all of their items from the crime scene consisting of clothes, bags, cigarettes, cosmetics and a lyrics book belonging to Anja. Police also found four knives but none of them were the murder weapons. Two of their bottles of alcohol were left behind with one containing an unknown fingerprint not belonging to any of the four. Several other items, however, were missing consisting of their wallets and ID cards, a knife, Seppo's leather jacket, two male watches, shoes and the keys to the motorcycles. Over the next few days, [police alongside several volunteers](https://imgur.com/vD4k9jR) and even soldiers conducted various searches of the campground. The police used metal detectors and dogs, [as well as searching the lake](https://imgur.com/k9Noo9t) and using divers to go to the bottom of Lake Bodom with every single item recovered from the bottom of the lake being recovered. On the side of the road 500 meters away from the crime scene, the police found [a pair of worn-out brown leather shoes](https://imgur.com/Up4fwA5) under a stone with several blood stains on them and another pair of shoes in the bushes across from the road. The first pair of shoes belonged to Nils while the other pair were Seppo's. Due to the violent nature of the crime, it was made the police's main priority. The police appealed to the public for information and asked them to come forward if they had any information on the killer. After this appeal, the police had to deal with dozens of false leads including people being reported to police for no other reason aside from being out late. None of those reported to police had any evidence indicating guilt and every single suspect was released. The police's investigation reached a dead end for the time being as they had no suspects. While the police were chasing leads the locals had their own suspect, a 51-year-old man named [Karl Valdemar Gyllström](https://imgur.com/WTrW6XB). Karl owned a Truck Stop and Kiosk nearby to the canteen and campsite so many campers would often visit his establishment to purchase various items. Karl was known for his violent temper which seemed to come and go. Karl would hide razor blades inside the apples growing on trees near his property to stop and punish the Children picking them and was known as a heavy drinker who despised campers at the lake. Karl was also known for attacking others. A local resident saw Karl illegally hunting on his land and when he asked Karl to leave he raised his shotgun and shot the man. While the wounds were not fatal the man had to go to the hospital to have shrapnel surgically removed. Karl also held an obsession with the right of way on the road. One time a truck was driving near his business which led to Karl shattering the glass and nearly causing an accident. Karl defended his actions to the police by saying he was trying to scare him off for driving too fast and honking his horn too loudly. Karl always kept a hunting knife and steal pipe on his person at all times and would wooden strips with nails sticking out on the roads to puncture the tires of passing cars and would trespass onto the campsite to cut and vandalize unoccupied tents. On June 4, Nils and Seppo had visited his truckstop truck stop and purchased some items before leaving. Karl wasn't working at the time so they conducted their transaction with his wife. After making their purchase they drove past Karl's house on their way to the campsite and Karl's wife admitted to her husband that there were four camping nearby. The morning after Karl was informed of the murders by a local and he reacted to this news very nonchalantly. Karl had just installed a well on his property which only made locals more suspicious, suspecting that Karl disposed of their belongings and the murder weapon at the bottom of the well. Their Nils and Seppo's shoes were also found on the road leading to his truck stop and home. Karl and his wife were questioned by police. Both Karl and his wife said they were sleeping the night of the murder with Karl staying in the living room and his wife sleeping upstairs with the couple's children. His wife did admit that the door was open but she didn't hear Karl leave. The police searched Karl's home but left after finding nothing of note. This search left the locals very dissatisfied since they viewed it as lacklustre and were especially disappointed with how they ignored the well and didn't search it. On June 9, [Nils woke up in the hospital](https://imgur.com/Cy9X9JK) but in severe pain and didn't know where he was. The police wanted to question him but Nils could barely speak often just moaning in pain and whenever he did speak he said that he didn't remember what happened. The police waited again until June 23 when he was discharged from the hospital and left through a backdoor to the police station to give a statement to the police. According to Nils, on June 4 he and Seppo set up their tent at 7:30 p.m. and hung up and spent time until 9:30 p.m. when they finally went to sleep. A few hours later, Nils woke up to the sound of Seppo outside the tent looking for fishing gear. Nils decided to accompany him and later wanted to go for a late swim anyway with Nils estimating that this was at 3:00 a.m. This testimony was considered accurate as Anja had written in her Lyric book \"Seppo and Nils were drunk\"; \"got up at two o'clock in the middle of the night\"; \"Seppo was fishing\" When the police pressed him for what happened next he said that his next memory was waking up in the hospital. The police brought him back to the crime scene in hopes that it could trigger some repressed memories but Nils still couldn't tell them what happened afterwards. The police now saw only one option left. They went to the University of Helsinki and requested that a professor specializing in psychiatry put him under hypnosis to dredge up Nils's memories, something this profession had success with with other patients. From July 2-July 5 Nils, was put under hypnosis three times with each session lasting one hour. Nils finally described how he and the others were attacked by a man with a knife and blunt object assumed to be a steel pipe. When asked if he could describe this man he said he could. Based on his description the police ruled that the man was 20–30 years old, 173–174 cm tall; had an ordinary body type, round face; long blond hair combed back; normal non-protruding ears. A high forehead: high forehead with uneven horizontal wrinkles, Thick lips, a strong jaw; slightly protruding cheekbones; short neck; white teeth, thick and large fingers, pimples on the forehead and cheeks and lastly he was wearing, a thick fabric checkered dark blouse with small black buttons. Based on this description [a composite sketch was made and released to the media](https://imgur.com/7BYnRA3). Police received 50 tips based on this sketch and arrested 9 suspects with one suspect being of particular interest. On June 6, 36-year-old German National [Hans Assmann](https://imgur.com/X6foYkG) arrived at The Helsinki Surgical Hospital by ambulance with red stains on his hands and overalls. His wife accompanied him to the hospital and said that Hans passed out after experiencing a bout of stomach pain. During their routine tests, a doctor poked Hans's side and in reaction, he let out a little chuckle which alerted hospital staff to the fact that he was likely unconscious. After he was caught in this lie Hans showed no remorse and threatened hospital staff, demanding immediate treatment. This prompted an intern and several other hospital workers to keep a close eye on Hans. During his stay in the hospital, a woman who wasn't his wife visited him at the hospital and they would whisper to each other although nobody knew what they were talking about. Hans would spend hours upon hours washing his hands to try and erase the red stains on his hands. When talking to hospital staff he told police he was a guard at Auschwitz but became disillusioned with Nazism after falling in love with a Jewish girl. He was reassigned and ended up being captured by the Red Army in 1943. After two years in a POW camp, he fully defected and joined the KGB. He was discharged from the hospital after a few days but continued to return for further treatment and to make the staff more uncomfortable. He once showed a surgeon an article from a German magazine about a cold case and joked that both he and the surgeon were good with a knife but that unlike the surgeon he didn't save anyone with a knife. By July the hospital staff grew more and more suspicious of Hans and later suspected him of being responsible for the Lake Bodom Murders. After seeing the sketch in the newspaper they only became more suspicious. They called the police and even collected Hans's bloody clothing to hand off to the police. Hans was, however, never actually arrested and his clothing wasn't tested. According to police, Hans had an airtight alibi but the police never released it to the public. Other suspects that came to the police's attention were a man named Pauli Luoma. Pauli was a bicycle thief who was seen in the area wearing a backpack that seemed similar to the one stolen from the campers and wearing what appeared to be a bloodied shirt. This man was quickly identified as Pauli but he had an airtight alibi and was seen by numerous witnesses at Otaniemi during the time of the murder. Another was 15-year-old Pentti Soininen. Despite his young age, Pentti had committed several violent crimes. In 1969, at 24 years old he was arrested and confessed to many crimes and told police that he was at Lake Bodom during the time of the murder after running away from school. Since he couldn't tell the police any details that wouldn't be gleaned from reading newspapers, no evidence linking him to the crime and Pentti was known for lying to try and build up a reputation the police gave little weight to his confession. Pentti hanged himself at a railway station during a prisoner transport. The last suspect we know the least about and the police seem to consider them POIs as opposed to real suspects. Two young men were seen fishing at the lake the night of the murder and would've witnessed the crime and possibly have valuable testimony. But instead, they left their fishing equipment on the rocks by the lake and left. They never returned to collect their equipment, were never identified and despite numerous appeals by the police, they never came forward. The police gradually ran out of leads and slowly and slowly updates in the investigation stopped being published in the newspapers. Eventually, the police ran out of leads to investigate and the case went cold. In the years that followed the locals continued to suspect Karl as the main suspect. Although Karl looked nothing like the sketch his behaviour was still enough as alongside his violent behaviour he sealed up that well of his only a few days after the murder. In the late 60s, his wife was diagnosed with breast cancer and when in the hospital she confessed to a friend that she believed Karl to be the murderer and gave a false alibi to the police out of fear over what Karl would do to her. The police, who were said to have an 80-page case file on Karl by this point visited the hospital to question Karl's wife who retracted her statement. Because she wouldn't make a statement and they had no evidence linking Karl to the murder they officially stopped all investigations of him in September of 1969. Prior to the closing of the investigation, Karl was sitting and drinking with a neighbour before Karl grew suddenly angered and saddened for no discernible reason. When the neighbour asked what the issue was Karl said \"Don't you realize it yet? I am the murderer behind the Lake Bodom Massacre.\" the neighbour said \"If that's true then go to the lake and drown yourself immediately. Otherwise, you will be locked up in a cell for the rest of your life.\" On August 2, 1969, the police found Karl's body floating in Lake Bodom with the cause of death ruled as likely suicide. As there were no independent witnesses to this alleged confession and on account of Karl being intoxicated and mentally unwell and topped off with a lack of evidence the police did not consider this enough to close the investigation and deem Karl the killer. As for Hans, In 1997 he was interviewed by a reporter and when asked if he was the murderer, rather than denying any involvement he said \"I can't disclose the details.\" which was believed to be a confession. One of the doctors who treated Hans also wrote three books about the case and how Hans was the likely killer. They even tried linking Hans to other unsolved cases such as the murder of Kyllikki Saari (he was in Germany at the time) and even the death of a Finnish parliament and minister named Penna Tervo (he died in a car accident but others think it might be foul play). Hans passed away on June 19, 1998, at a hospital in Sweeden In 2005 the police finally declassified what info they had on Hans. In 1960 after the hospital called police, Hans was interrogated but they quickly learnt that he had a strong alibi. At the time of the murder, he was staying with his mistress at their apartment in Helsinki as he was having an extramarital affair. He was seen by the landlord, landlady, her mistress's sister and her husband. It was impossible for him to leave without being noticed by anyone and he woke up and made coffee from 6:00-9:00 a.m. the next morning. Which by then would've put him in the clear. The blood on his clothing was red paint, his strange behaviour was due to intoxication and the reason for his hospitalization was stomach pain as his wife had said. The police had Hans's fingerprints on file and in 1978 reopened the investigation to compare them to unknown fingerprints found on soda cans at the crime scene and they weren't a match. The public was still unsatisfied and continued believing that Hans was the killer based on his resemblance to the sketch. Many also noticed in pictures at the memorial service taken on June 13, 1960, [that there was a man amongst the mourners](https://imgur.com/mfri4HJ) who looked like the man in the sketch with many believing Hans attended the funeral to relive the experience of the murder. The police, on the other hand, stopped putting much faith in the sketch. It was found that hypnosis could also induce false memories. Olavi was also put under hypnosis and described a similar man but that was 6 years after the fact when the first sketch was already known. There was another reason the sketch was disregarded though, and that being that Nils may have been lying. In 2003 with many advancements in DNA testing and forensic technology made in the 43 years since, the case was reopened. All the evidence that had blood stains on them was tested and on March 29, 2004, the police arrested [Nils Wilhelm Gustafsson who was now a 62-year-old semi-retired truck driver and pensioner](https://imgur.com/6alBsuP). The DNA tests showed that the victim's blood was found on Nils's shoes but not his own. The police believed that on the night of the murder Nils, heavily intoxicated prepared a pack of condoms and attempted to have sex with Maila who rejected him leading to Nils getting angry and Seppo stepping between Nils and the two girls and was told to leave the tent. Fueled by alcohol, rage and adrenaline, Nils waited until all three were asleep before cutting the tent ropes to trap everyone inside. Nils knew where everyone was in the tent and started his attack. He picked up a rock off the ground and started hitting Seppo on the head with it. Seppo resisted and kept kicking eventually hitting Nils in the jaw through the tent. This caused a fracture which further enraged Nils who took out his knife and began stabbing him several times through the tent fabric in the chest and neck. Afterwards, Anja attempted to leave the tent. Nils saw this and began hitting her on the head with a rock over and over again until she stopped moving. He finished the attack with Maila repeatedly hitting her head with a rock before stabbing her 15 times. After killing the three he collected all the aforementioned items and left the campsite to hide them with the man witnessed leaving the campsite being Nils himself. After he was done he returned to the campsite to cut open and collapse the tent in order to make the crime scene appear more \"chaotic\" and pulled down Maila's pants to make the crime look like an attempted rape and finished by lying on top of the collapsed tent and waited for someone to discover the crime scene. The next day the press got wind of the arrest and published Nils's name in the newspaper a 61-year-old woman came forward with a statement. She told police that back in 1960 she was 17 years old and camping with her friends when she saw Nils arguing with others and that this was after the murder. She later saw two men who weren't police officers carrying Nils away. When pressed for more details she was unable to name or describe these other men and possible accomplices. Nils denied any involvement and accused this woman of lying as he had never seen her and Anja's lyric book with the entries further proved his innocence as they made no reference to an argument and there were no signs of erasing or pages being torn. The police handed the case over to the prosecutor who charged Nils with three counts of murder. On April 2, 2004, The Espoo District Court felt there was enough to bring the case to trial. The Trial began on August 4, 2005, with Nils pleading not guilty and the prosecutor was Heikki Lampela (who has had future legal troubles himself) demanded a life sentence. The prosecution repeated the same theory as the police and said that Nils only suffered a minor concussion and accused him of lying about his amnesia to avoid implicating himself. For the trial, [the tent was restored and displayed](https://i.imgur.com/XLrbJiR.jpeg) for the court. This ended up playing a crucial role in proving Nils's innocence. Nils's two attorneys Riitta Leppiniemi and Heikki Uotila began their arguments. They disputed the idea that it was Nils who threw his and Seppo's shoes in the bushes as in that case he would've walked back to the campsite all by himself either barefoot or just in socks. This was an issue because both the soles of his feet and socks were clean and showed no signs of walking that long distance. The prosecutor claimed that the tent was cut and stabbed through after the murders to contaminate the crime scene. Thanks to the restored tent Nils's attorneys were able to poke holes in his theory. [Based on the blood stains on the tent all located alongside the location of the stab wounds](https://imgur.com/O9wFTuw) strongly indicated that the victims were stabbed through the tent. The police also pointed out how the prosecutor and police in their theory of how the crime took place also included Nils stabbing them through the tent. Nils had sustained many non-self-inflicted stab wounds which contradicted the police and prosecution's theory that all that happened was Seppo kicking his jaw through the tent. Only blood stains from the four victims were found at the scene and the prosecution didn't believe others were involved in the crime. The defence refuted this claim, only 20 blood samples taken from 11 locations had been tested which meant the police and prosecutors had no way for sure to rule out the existence of a 5th individual. The DNA by that point had also been degrading for 45 years and even if the results were accurate, if the murderer was adequately prepared and attacked from outside the tent, they may not have shed a single drop of blood. The defence also turned the DNA results against them and pointed out how Nils's blood was found in the location where he claimed to be sleeping. They argued that if he was the killer his blood should not have been inside the tent. The defence also relied on eyewitnesses who saw others walking away from the tent at the same time Nils was lying unconscious on top of it. Lastly, while the prosecution called upon neurological experts to testify and they stated that Nils only suffered a minor concussion the defence and their experts thought this was laughable. He had been unconscious for nearly 5 days, suffered permanent brain damage and memory loss and was unable to maintain his balance for weeks after waking up and had to use a cane. The prosecutor and police also never explained where his severe injuries came from. As a last-ditch effort, a police officer guarding Nils's cell during his pre-trial detention was made to testify about an alleged confession made by Nils. The officer said that Nils said \"What does it matter?, What's done is done. The worst case scenario is that I will be sentenced to 15 years.\" which they felt amounted to a confession. There was no written statements or recordings of him saying this and Nils himself, denied ever uttering such words. The context of him making this statement was also never stated so the court had any testimony on this disregarded and that it wasn't a valid confession assuming it even happened. On October 7, 2005, the six-judge panel reached their verdict. Based on his blood found inside the tent, the impossibility of disposing and hiding evidence with his injuries and a lack of evidence and exonerating witness testimony they found Nils not guilty with the acquittal being unanimous. As the prosecutor didn't appeal the verdict within the allotted 7 days Nils was released and given 44,900 euros in compensation. Due to the media reporting heavily on the case and labelling Nils as a murderer he stayed inside his house and rarely ever left to avoid anyone confronting him on the street. After his acquittal he attempted to seek compensation from the media and newspapers for defamation but withdrew the lawsuit after he could find any lawyers to take the case. No new suspects ever came forward his acquittal. 63 years later the case remains unsolved. ***Sources*** [***https://web.archive.org/web/20081210112643/http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20040405IE7***](https://web.archive.org/web/20081210112643/http://www2.hs.fi/english/archive/news.asp?id=20040405IE7) [***https://ermakvagus.com/Europe/Finland/lake-bodom-murders.htm***](https://ermakvagus.com/Europe/Finland/lake-bodom-murders.htm) [***https://yle.fi/a/3-5744609***](https://yle.fi/a/3-5744609) [***https://web.archive.org/web/20061216183708/http://www.iltasanomat.fi/uutiset/erikoissivut.asp?k=1038765***](https://web.archive.org/web/20061216183708/http://www.iltasanomat.fi/uutiset/erikoissivut.asp?k=1038765) [***https://web.archive.org/web/20060501025544/http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/taustat/id15657.html***](https://web.archive.org/web/20060501025544/http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/taustat/id15657.html) [***https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2011/12/09/bodominjarven-synkka-salaisuus***](https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2011/12/09/bodominjarven-synkka-salaisuus) [***https://web.archive.org/web/20110820092012/http://www.nyrkkirauta.kalsarit.net/\\~mb5196/waldemar/alibi80.htm***](https://web.archive.org/web/20110820092012/http://www.nyrkkirauta.kalsarit.net/~mb5196/waldemar/alibi80.htm) [***https://www.lansivayla.fi/paikalliset/1740609***](https://www.lansivayla.fi/paikalliset/1740609) [***https://www.kaleva.fi/bodom-jutun-uutisoinnista-ei-syytteita/2364256***](https://www.kaleva.fi/bodom-jutun-uutisoinnista-ei-syytteita/2364256) [***https://yle.fi/a/3-11614144***](https://yle.fi/a/3-11614144)",

I thought I would feel so much relief completing chemo, but my anxiety has been on overload. I’m having trouble sleeping, I randomly cry, I wake up in a panic. I haven’t felt like this since first being diagnosed. I have an appointment with my breast surgeon today. I’m sure we will set a date for my double mastectomy. As horrible as chemo was, it was consistent and I knew what to expect. Now it’s time to move on to the next phase. I know surgery will obviously happen, which I’m terrified about. The only time I’ve had surgery before was getting my port put in. I will be getting implants. I have put off making an appointment with a plastic surgeon because…anxiety. I will do that this week. My surgeon and oncologist originally told me I would not need radiation as it luckily didn’t spread to lymph nodes. Then in June, I asked my surgeon if I could possibly be a candidate for immediate reconstruction and he said it depends on if I need radiation or not. So that being up in the air has me stressed, surgery has me stressed, the upcoming scans has me stressed, and the hope of reaching PCR has me stressed. I do have Xanax that I use as needed. I was taking them very infrequently, but now have been needing to take at least one daily. I know once I get through surgery and get the pathology I will feel better.

BEWARE SPOILERS!*** Millions of years ago, the Milky Way galaxy was dominated by the **Igraen** Empire. Power-hungry and obsessed with stability and continuity, the Igraens grew ancient and powerful, and ultimately unlocked the secret to technological immortality. They divorced their minds from their bodies, created “Dataspace” as a shadow to the world of matter and energy, and retreated into its depths to live in a format incomprehensible to meat-based life. They left behind the **Hierarchy,** a secretive order of their most independent minds, capable of hijacking any living being through cybernetic implantation. Since the Igraens’ ascension, this Hierarchy has ruled the Milky Way from the shadows, maintaining the status quo that keeps the Hegemony safe and undisturbed. Their methods are horrific, genocidal and sinister...and for millions of years, they have succeeded in their task. The Igraens also left behind their discarded bodies, now reduced to beings of pure slavering instinct and no sense of self preservation. The so-called **“Hunters”** became one of the Hierarchy’s most useful pawns, keeping the galaxy’s weak civilizations contained and cowed by the constant threat of becoming “Prey.” In the Hierarchy’s estimation, the greatest threat to the Hegemony’s existence would be the rise of a **Deathworlder** civilization, sapient life from one of the galaxy’s deadly inhospitable planets. Every such civilization has been ruthlessly expunged by nuclear fire, invasion and guile...but even the Hierarchy is not perfect. It was inevitable that, eventually, they would be thwarted. Their great failure was engineered by an organization of unknown origin and size, who identify themselves only as **Singularity,** and who managed to smuggle one single, promising deathworld under the Hierarchy’s radar. Specifically: the **Earth.** To the Human race, the Earth is just home. Her howling storms, strong gravity, spouting volcanoes, virulent plagues and fierce predators are simple facts of life. Scrubbing the bacteria from our teeth and washing our hands are routine necessities, and our cities are planned to prepare for earthquakes, tsunamis and freezing winters. To the many sapient life forms that make up the Interspecies Dominion---the intellectual Corti, the populous Vzk’Tk, the slow but sophisticated Guvnuragnaguvendrugun, the fractious Kwmbwrw, the Robalin, Mjrnhrm, Versa Volc, Rauwrhyr and many, many more---Earth and the planets like it are death. And Humans? Humans are monsters. Terrifyingly quick, strong enough to rip the Hunters limb-from-limb, cunning and inventive enough to be impossible to predict and capable of so, so much more than our comfortable lives usually demand of us. By the time the Hierarchy even noticed we existed, it was too late to contain us. When Humanity spread to the stars, we did so with a few false starts. Alien civilizations, panicked by the prospect of a Deathworlder civilization, wrapped the whole Sol system in an impenetrable containment field, only for one of their own politicians to treacherously open a back door. The planet **Cimbrean,** originally settled with the best intentions of conserving its native ecosystem, was ultimately doomed by a careless human taking a comfort break in the woods. A Hierarchy agent operating on Earth bombed and destroyed the city of San Diego rather than face capture. But there were successes too. Friends were made, other deathworlders rescued from their inevitable demise. Thanks to humanity the Clans of Gao were united under a new Great Father, **Daar** of Clan Stoneback, and saved from extinction. On the high-G planet Akyawentuo, the native jungle-dwelling Ten’Gewek were delivered from the Hierarchy’s terrible machines and introduced to the secrets of steel and “sky-thinking.” And at the point of the spear is the **HEAT:** the Hazardous Environment Assault Team, the very best of the allied nations’ special operators, enhanced with alien medication and high-tech armor to take the fight deep into the very worst the Hierarchy and the Hunters can give...and to win it. The galaxy has changed forever. The old powers are doomed. This is the story of their downfall. ___ ##ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, THANKS AND DEDICATIONS This chapter was brought to you with the help of my **Patrons and Subscribers** ***The SOR*** *Those special individuals whose contributions to this story go above and beyond mere money* cTwelve, BitterBusiness, Sally and Stephen Johnson Sian, Steve, Willow and Riker ___ **65** ***Humans*** TTTA Adam Shearsby Anthony Landry Anthony Youhas Armond471 Austin Deschner Chris Dye Culverit (with apologies for missing you last month) Daniel Morris Devin Rousso Eric Hardwick His Dread Monarch James Ren Joseph Szuma Joshua A.

          "selftext": "Poland. Year 1990. After the fall of communism in 1989, Poland transitions to democracy and a free market economy. The economic state of the country is still in shambles, but there is a lot of hope for the future. For Polish people, 1980s were synonymous with violent political oppression and poverty. For Americans, 80s are a source of nostalgia for stuff like playing DnD or trying out cool NES games. The Iron Curtain was now gone and all that stuff started arriving to Poland too, but in the 90s. Too bad everyone was dirt poor though. The new and cool Western products were an object of fascination. After all, all of it was previously completely unobtainable. Why on earth am I rambling about the economic state of 1990s Poland in a Hobby Drama write up? Because it's a backdrop from where the hero of our tale emerged. **1. THE LIFE AND DEATH OF KATAN: POLISH TTRPG SCENE IN THE 90S** Kryształy Czasu (English: Crystals of Time) are a tabletop RPG system created by Artur Szyndler sometime in the 1980s - one of the very first Polish TTRPGs, in fact! According to Szyndler, the work started around 1984-1985, but the system was completed around 1990. Clearly his passion project, it was originally distributed in the form of floppy disks or in handwritten notebooks at fantasy fan meetups by the author himself. Later on in 1993, a revised version of the system was published by a Polish fantasy magazine *Magia i Miecz*, spreading it far and wide. How was the system? Well... According to [an article I found](https://fanbojizycie.wordpress.com/2015/08/21/krysztaly-czasu-w-to-sie-kiedys-gralo/), Crystals of Time were never really well regarded. Common criticisms included lack of proofreading, an absurdly inconsistent universe that regurgitates common fantasy tropes, lack of balancing, rules bloated with tons of unnecessary dice rolls, and insane random encounters/effects that could literally end the game on the spot (such as a side effect of a spell being able to erase the entire party of players from existence) and - most importantly - a characteristic, inept writing style. Put a pin in this last one. My brother - a hardcore TTRPG fan and a Game Master for many years - described it to me as \"*about as fun as filing tax documents*\" and that he \"*thought someone wrote it as a joke*\". Take that as you will, but I've never heard him say stuff like this about any other system. However, it should be noted the system did have legitimate fans - its biggest strength was its accessibility (and the fact it was free). What other options were there? Back then you couldn't just walk into a store and buy a DnD manual. You couldn't even pirate it because no one owned a computer. The least you could count on was a barely readable photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy of someone's DnD manual. In English. So good luck with decyphering all of that! If you even know any English in the first place. So you're stuck here. You're stuck with Crystals of Time. Author of the aforementioned article, Piotr Muszyński, writes that Crystals of Time garnered a lot of goodwill from the public at the time because it was a Polish product created in a time when they were automatically seen as lesser than the cool, shiny, Western stuff that just started to show up, so the system got some praise for the effort alone. And while CoT faded away with an advent of other imported TTRPGs such as Warhammer, DnD or Old World of Darkness, it still had a very small yet dedicated fanbase of nostalgic middle aged fantasy nerds. Crystals of Time were mostly forgotten... until they suddenly came back into the spotlight. In the strangest way possible. **2. THE RETURN OF KATAN: A CROWDFUNDING SAGA** Poland. Year 2014. Artur Szyndler starts a [campaign on a crowdfunding website polakpotrafi.pl](http://polakpotrafi.pl/projekt/kc). Crystals of Time are back, baby! ...This time, as a novel - titled *Crystals of Time: Katan's Saga: Labyrinth* *of Death, part 1 and 2* (*Kryształy Czasu: Saga o Katanie: Labirynt Śmierci, część 1 i 2*). As a true fantasy epic, a new modern classic that will surely be discussed and analyzed for eons. The goal of the campaign was raising money for the creation of the first volume out of planned 13 entries (each split in 2 books) in *Crystals of Time: Katan's Saga*. The description of the campaign goes into detail about turning Crystals of Time into a franchise, which are unusually ambitious for a mostly forgotten TTRPG from the 90s. As Szyndler himself wrote: \"*as you can see, our foresight extends further than the astrologers are able to foresee*\" - and goddamn, he wasn't kidding. So, what was the goal? A mere 55 THOUSAND Polish złoty (\\~15000USD). A small price to pay for a literary masterpiece. And this is when people started getting skeptical. As the wider internet learned of the campaign, they started [noticing quite a lot of red flags](https://yetiograch.pl/blog/poradnik-rozpoznac-trefna-zbiorke/). To release a book, you'd feasibly need a team of a couple people, like editor and beta readers. *Crystals of Time: Katan's Saga* boasted a team of nearly 40 PEOPLE(!!!), including 12 editors and 14 graphic designers. The campaign also had an [official youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@krysztayczasu6519/videos), which posted a lot of trailers to drum up hype. The trailers are quite amateurish and consist mostly of recitations of very bad poetry about the island archipelagos of Ochria. And there's also a [traditional dwarven funeral song, which is 22 minutes long](https://youtu.be/1NfwF7TVUrU?si=qm5DgmLqQcIABWmU). In case you need some cool tunes for your sex playlist. It's not a secret that the author also had quite an ego. Take a look at what he had to say about the book! &gt;*\"The scale of CoT. How many times do I have to say that the thing you knew up to this point was merely 1-5% of everything I came up with? Over 25 years ago, before Magia i Miecz, it was 3700 pages - including the universe. Some have seen these documents - a pile of 1,5m height. And now the scale of CoT is right before your eyes. And this is just the beginning...* &gt;*\"The last thing is what the beta readers said. You read this book for the first time for all the action. It's hard to stop reading - I promise. For the second time, you'll read the book to understand the world, because the information are scattered across many chapters. You cannot know everything without getting to some longer descriptions. For the third time, you'll be reading it for the schemes, mysteries and subplots. Decyphering it all is an essence of all 13 volumes. I don't recommend doing it during the first read. There is too much to comprehend. You must understand, this isn't a normal book.\"* &gt;*\"As I said from the start, this book will shock you with its ideas. The things that nowadays seem absurd will be soon throughly analyzed.\"* &gt;*\"The writing style is what it is. You have to accept it, or not read at all. Sometimes the suspense will be jarring, but I will remain consistent.\"* &gt;*\"As some of you already noticed, the competition isn't resting and already started to create bad reviews for the book. A few of the sponsored \"counter-articles\" were already detected by you all. I didn't expect them to be so fast.\"* &gt;*\"Biggest assets of the first volume of Katan's Saga are the 25 vibrant characters of our party and their unbelievable experiences, as well as the plot of the novel rushing forward like a meteorite.\"* Artur Szyndler also stated that he hates writing descriptions of this universe that he's so proud of, so he'll put them in between chapters in the form of poetry. Or, as he calls it, a *\"rhymed prose\"*. He also defiantly defended himself from doubters by stating that *\"if someone is looking for a beautiful writing style, they should go read* [*Mickiewicz*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Mickiewicz) *instead.\"* Normally it would've been a little worrying to hear these things from the next literary sensation, buuuuuuuut.... Oh hey, look, this masterpiece will have [exactly **700** different fantasy races](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CHSv7mT_rbM) and 25 main characters! And if you give Artur 20000 or 50000 złoty, he will make YOU into one of the protagonists of his book! It would be a shame not to take this golden opportunity and be forever immortalized in literature! And then Szyndler uploaded a few chapters as samples to the campaign page. This is when the internet got their first taste of the book. And oh boy, the result was not good. **3. HALF-FJORDS, HARMONY AND BAD POETRY: SZYNDLER'S LICENTIA POETICA** Before we dive into the endless void that is the book's plot, we should talk about how this thing is written. Let's say this straight up: the book is a car crash and attracted bile fascination ever since the internet saw the sample chapters for the first time. Due to its clumsy, yet weirdly captivating writing style and absurd over-the-top plot, it frequently loops back into being the greatest unintentional parody you'll ever read. The book is full of word salad, grammatical and spelling errors and features a stream of consciousness-type narration, which was confirmed to be a result of Szyndler literally dictating the book to people who were writing it down for him. (Or, as haters referred it to as, \"the transcript of a TTRPG campaign ran by the worst Dungeon Master in the entire school\".) The most characteristic Szyndler-isms include: * Quotation marks in completely random places, such as calling a group of literal TITANS *\"a gathering of many unbelievably \"tall\" foes\"* or phrases like *\"His eyes almost \"popped out of his skull\"(...)\"* * Szyndler's inexplicable obsession with describing things as \"half-\"something. Half-plates. Half-plane. Half-life. Half-mammal. Half-fjords... * Describing things as \"*some sort of \\_\\_\\_*\" or saying that things happened \"*probably*\", as if the narrator himself wasn't sure what he's talking about. Yet at the same time the book will state **extremely** specific numbers of things, such as revealing that a character twirled exactly 253 times during her dance, or thatsomeone is *\"one of the most important gods in over 126 455 pantheons\".* * Ellipsis... showing up.... constantly... * Whenever a problem in the plot has an easy solution, the characters immediately dismiss it because *\"it would disrupt the harmony\"*. No, they don't elaborate. The harmony must be swinging wildly like a pendulum because they disrupt it like 3 times a page. * Random creatures, places and things are always described as by their \"essence\". It's a frighteningly common occurence to read that our main characters *\"passed by a powerful enemy, a* ***seaweed existence born from essence of vitality and nothingness***\" and then we have to move on like it never happened. * The ballads - long works of VERY questionable poetry that are stuck into the plot. They mostly detail geography, inhabitants and customs of lands and races who are completely unrelated to the story. In-universe, they are masterpieces created by the party's bard, and literally everyone constantly praises his genius and god-given talent. These go for dozens of pages at the time, so I hope you enjoy the worst rhymes ever concieved by man. * The narration jumping wildly between different subplots with a subtelty and grace of a cocaine-fueled chimpanzee. * Szyndler has ZERO sense of scale. It constantly leads to situations where the party will enter a room in a dungeon and have a random encounter with a thousand harpies or a million gargoyles. This isn't a problem limited to the novel either. In the equally clumsily written TTRPG, the capital city of the orc empire (with a population of a few millions) has a sole food source, which are... the fish from a local lake. * Every single time someone casts a spell, the spell is mentioned to be \"ancient\", \"forbidden\", or \"ancient and forbidden\". Sometimes the spell's level is also stated. Characters also talk about their classes, levels and allignments all the time. I'm slightly disappointed we don't learn how much EXP they earn. * A lot of characters in the book are based on the author's friends and, in one case, even the author himself. Often this fact is only cleverly disguised by spelling their names backwards (Kemot = Tomek, Skela = Aleks...). * Crystals of Time universe has every single fantasy race, creature, spell, land and concept ever implemented in other fantasy stories. All of them. All of them at once. Which is a shame because some of Szyndler's ideas are quite interesting, but they get drowned out by this noise of unnecessary information and concepts. Nothing is presented and elaborated on, its only listed out somewhere and exists solely to bloat the book with MORE STUFF. * The characters die and come back to life so frequently that you can risk a statement that *Crystals of Time* is the most pro-life book ever written. As a fun little sidenote: Artur Szyndler also had a short stint as a politician. [He ran in local elections in 2007](https://wybory2007.pkw.gov.pl/SJM/PL/WYN/19/W2804/19.htm), but didn't get a mandate. He was member of *Prawo i Sprawiedliwość* party. If you're a Polish citizen, you probably know where this is going. If you aren't a Polish citizen - if you ever heard anything about the political state in Poland during the last 8 years (such as a near total ban on abortion,etc)... Those were the guys in power. Which brings me to the final Szyndler-ism... * Sexist and racist content! There isn't a single woman in this book that doesn't get naked. Female characters stripping and/or having sex with something/someone is a frequent solution to any problem the party faces. Szyndler seems to be weirdly fixated on putting subplots \"just for women\" in his book, with... really interesting results. The situation wasn't exactly helped [by](https://www.blekitnyswit.pl/2014/08/11/krysztaly-czasu-na-avangardzie/) [these](https://www.blekitnyswit.pl/2014/02/22/krysztaly-czasu-powracaja-relacja-ze-spotkania-z-arturem-szyndlerem/?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR0UOmuIbIpNuX7i5BK2ck3Rp4fHyjvJdXHKwMYOxyiDRkUmZm_m-q82__I_aem_BBrbyabL0Bd1SSVXKXQK1Q) [posts](https://www.blekitnyswit.pl/2014/09/10/krysztaly-czasu-na-polconie/) detailing Szyndler's quotes and opinions expressed during his convention panels. Highlights include the claim that the book with *\"feature subplots for men (battles, fights, duels, weapons) and women (romances, seduction, interior design, raising children)\"*, or the fact that Szyndler likened RPG systems in which the GM does not calculate the result of the dice roll, but instead decides the effect to be a sign of fall of our civilization and \\*somehow\\* connected it to there being *\"Jihad in France\".* Take that, Matt Mercer! Shockingly, the campaign did not reach its goal, therefore no money was gained. It raised over 7000zł (\\~1800USD), and had only 69 backers. And even though this money was supposedly needed to fund **writing of the novel**, the book, in all its 1400-page glory, inexplicably... came out anyway shortly after. In all its self-published, barely coherent, typo-ridden glory, of course. As a cherry on top, despite allegedly employing 14 graphic designers, all illustrations in the book have very small resolutions, leaving them very visibly pixelated in print. Szyndler changed his mind about the goal, and the campaign was now supposed to be funding special \"collectors editions\" of his book all along, or something. Was the campaign intended to be a scam? I don't know, and I won't make a definitive statement. All I'm sure about is that he clearly had no idea what he was doing. **4. KATAN'S SAGA: HEY, WHAT ON EARTH IS THIS BOOK EVEN ABOUT?** I read the book three times and all I know is it's an ultimate test of reading comprehension. Summarizing the plot in short (or coherent) fashion is literally impossible, so instead I decided to go for a small collections of Greatest Hits - both in plot point and quotes form. Not really highlights, more like... uh, lowlights. The main plot of the saga is centered around the hunt for an evil deity called NATAK the God Slayer. Natak pissed off all the gods so much that they decided to get rid of him for good - by travelling to his birthplace and killing him while he's weak. Two gods, Asteriusz the Great and Gorlam the Brave (2 of our 25 protagonists), travel to the land of Ochria 9000 years earlier, which - by complete coincidence - is also the time and birthplace of an orc named KATAN, future god-dictator who rules Ochria. Can you guess where this plot is going? Because Artur Szyndler thinks you don't, and seemingly sets it up as if it was a plot twist. Unfortunately for us, Asteriusz and Gorlam are the two most unobservant morons that ever lived. The two eventually meet baby Katan, who is being cared for by an amnesiac priest of an unknown deity, who grants him an absurd amount of power to protect the kid. Once Katan is a toddler, he starts wielding two \"half-plates\" (weapons) called the God Slayers. At one point the priest starts a chant for Natak the God Slayer. At another, the priest literally says the obvious twist to Asteriusz and Gorlam's faces, but they \"weren't listening\", so I guess their CSI-level investigation will go on for the next 26 half-volumes. You'll catch that nefarious Natak one day, guys! I believe in you! The actual plot of volume 1 is about a group of paladins, who decided to... stand in the middle of a forest and practice sword fighting right next to the Tree of Balance, which inevitably gets chopped down - which will cause the destruction of the world very soon, because \"*the harmony was disrupted*\". The world's only hope is now our party (and Asteriusz, and Gorlam, and Katan...), who have to travel to the Labyrinth of Death, a dungeon/eldritch location, to bring back a new magical sapling. The rest of the plot is just increasingly absurd random encounters on their way to the tree. It's like Dungeon Meshi, if Ryoko Kui consumed a lethal dose of LSD. The funniest part is that they end up accidentally destroying that new sapling as well, making their 1400-page long quest ultimately pointless. \\*\\*\\* Remember those sample chapters on the campaign page? Keep this in mind: this is how the book introduced itself to the world. Hannah, originally introduced as a tough and heartless elven assassin, gets immediately brainwashed by Asteriusz to be his devotee, and essentially becomes the party's resident prostitute. She offers a dance to the leader of the mountain giants in exchange for letting the party through and what follows after is a roughly **10-page long** sequence of Hannah stripping and breasting boobily all over the place. And it truly has to be read to be believed. &gt;*\"Suddenly her thin body jumped into the air. Her hands, held high, were pretending to be a geyser. At almost one meter up in the air, the girl began her spin. And not a normal one.* *(...)* *Only her hands waved every time, like wings of an albatross. Some were sure the girl was really flying. They saw the dancing leaps into the air, all almost of four meter distance, combined with preserving the one meter height throughout their distance.* *(...)* *Snake movements of the spinning black mamba were reaching the higher parts of the elf's body. When they reached her buttocks, most of present men bit their lips. Paladins took off their helmets and stretched out their necks to see better. And they had a lot to look at. The chiseled muscles of her female butt, covered only by elastic black cloth, perfectly showing off her moves. Each of her buttocks not only shrunken, straightened or wiggled separately, but one could see a moving barrier between these two styles of dance.* *(...)* *Girl's perky breasts seemed like they don't want to submit to the snake movements. They tried to shiver, jump, and even flapped around to the sides.* *(...)* *The dance continued to mirror the movements of a snake running away from paladins.* *(...)* *Her breasts continued to land once to the left, then to the right, while still maintaining their perkiness.* *(...)* *Both legs changed their positions to the rhythm of the music. Their fast movements made noticing the change impossible. Once left, and then right leg, took turns on the ground while the other one waited, with a knee bent so hard her feet touched the buttock - just like a heron.* *(...)* *The spectators then realized two things. One was that the legs of the dancer were distracting everyone from the breasts, the second - that her tiny steps started shaping some sort of strange pattern. Only half of them recognized the point of this sequence and its meaning. From time to time, separated by one long \"step\", she was spelling out her name with the stomped drops of sweat. On the stone floor of the \"chamber\" you could see her name - Hannah.\"* And then our elven stripper Hannah starts spinning during her dance. She spins exactly 253 times until all her internal organs are crushed by the force. And then she dies. Don't worry, she gets better. Later in the book she gets married 3 times, to 3 guys, all of which are clones, all are named \"Nameless\", and are also the eldritch abominations ruling the Labyrinth of Death. The upside is that at least she's not at risk of mixing up any names in her polycule. \\*\\*\\* The party decides to adopt a pre-pubescent medusa princess named Mantisa, despite the fact that once she comes of age she will automatically turn evil, so they'll have to kill her anyway. And she can become evil at any time. It doesn't stop one of our paladins from marrying Mantisa the next day, and the two become a true power couple on the battlefield as well. And by that I mean that tan Arkadian is carring Mantisa on his back at all times during combat. &gt;*\"Additionally, he \\[Arkadian\\] felt that during the more energetic movements that his helmet was touching her naked breasts\"* Which he felt somehow. Through his helmet. &gt;*\"The surprised demonic knight was baffled when Mantisa's nipples pierced into his helmet's visor. The moment of inattentiveness costed him a bit too much. The paladin cut into his demonic hands. (...) Tan Arkadian, pleased with the idea, praised his partner.* &gt;*\"Bravo! Your sight worked on him! Next time make sure to stare into his eyes longer, so that he pertrifies.\"* &gt;*Mantisa decided not to correct the young knight.\"* It should be noted that Mantisa is pre-pubescent only as a Medusa, and is explicitly stated to be 18 - the same age as her husband. But later on the party walks into a trap that makes everyone 1 year younger. Except Mantisa, who got 4 years younger, due to her species' weird obsession with number 4. Arkadian briefly considers that their age gap might be weird now, to which she replies that they got married at 18, and \"*if someone is outraged by the physical love between a 14 and 17 year old, then it's their own problem*\". We thankfully don't have to ponder the ethics of... all \\*this\\*, because Arkadian decides to walk into the trap 3 more times, so that he can be the same age as his wife. And they say chivalry is dead! Mantisa also has a quirky habit of murdering other female characters if they even breathe in Arkadian's direction. That includes murdering literal newborns. (Don't worry, they get better.) I think these might be the \"subplots for women\" that Szyndler hyped up. \\*\\*\\* During the very same fight with the demonic knight, a samurai/salamander woman named tan Sunin shows us her best moves as well. &gt;*\"The knight, clinging to life, kept defending himself. (...) supernatural magic and endurance gave him a chance to survive longer,* ***giving him an extra hour of life****. (...)* ***After two hours****, only this energy kept its master alive, stopping the bleeding and continuing the \"fight\". (...) When tan Tacjan fell to his knees, tan Sunin kept slicing. Obedient to the will of her race, the wrath of god and fate, that she was an instrument of. Only some time later,* ***after 3 hours*** *of this strange execution, she took a little break and changed her weapon and a target of attack.\"* Biggest mystery is how the demonic knight did not die **from boredom**. \\*\\*\\* &gt;*\"It was just then tan Kemot realised he's actually naked, and his two long rods of manliness are celebrating the return of the arms just as joyously as he is.\"* Typical *Crystals of Time* experience: reading a page and suddenly getting slapped in the face with an unexpected sentence like this. \\*\\*\\* During one of the YouTube trailers we can see the list of 700 races appearing in this story. Those who were particularly eagle-eyed noticed that the list contains [silverfish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silverfish) (pl: rybiki cukrowe), a completely normal species of bugs. It was a common belief that it was probably a prank from some staffer who snuck it into the list without Szyndler knowing. That is, until the book came out, and it turns out it contains a poem about a species of 3-meter tall, armoured silverfish living on the edge of space, who are singlehandedly saving the local economy by... locals gathering and eating their excrements. Which, I remind you, is all written as a POEM. When Szyndler wrote that \"his book will surprise even the most hardened fantasy veterans\", he wasn't fucking lying - the man didn't even hesitate before writing a ballad about nutritional properties of space bug poop. \\*\\*\\* One of the paladins, a guy named tan Sahrac, is inexplicably revealed to be a legendary Mother of All Invasions, a 4-meter tall double-spider (a giant spider with another giant spider as a head), ruler of all spider races who ravage the land. He was just pretending to be a human, because he likes being a cool paladin, and it would be pretty hard to swordfight as a spider. Sahrac committed to the bit so hard that he also has a human wife, two kids, and makes it very clear he prefers to identify as male. He speaks with a lisp as well. Much later in the story he, while in spider form, lays a (somehow fertile) egg. It results in a daughter who is a new spider princess. (Baby spider kills Katan, but don't worry, he gets better.) Incredibly progressive stuff from a man who used to be a member of a homophobic right wing political party. Most definitely not on purpose. *\\*\\*\\** Speaking of strange gender-related content. Our paladins eventually discover that they've been followed by a 4-meter tall stone sphinx, who has the exact same face as Asteriusz the Great, for some reason. And that this sphinx was following them ALL ALONG, but was invisible. The sphinx's name is Tifra, and she's actually female. She has Asteriusz's face because she's his #1 fan. She's also married to a paladin/giant tan Imar and pregnant with his baby, which they conceived via divine intervention. Because, I remind you, she's made out of stone. I should note that tan Imar is the only black guy in this book, and coincidentally also the only one who speaks entirely in broken Polish. Funny how that works! &gt;*\"A loud \"Nooo!!!\" escaped tan Imar's clenched jaws.\"* Tan Imar also has his Ventriloquism skill levelled up all they way to 99. His shock is understandable, because he just witnessed his pregnant sphinx wife have her fetus forcibly aborted on the battlefield by their archenemy. The fetus survived the abortion thanks to yet another divine intervention, and is now a half-giant half-necrosphinx. Thankfully, Asteriusz resurrects the ghost of Tifra as well. As he claims: *\"I will form her into a being in a shape of an angel. Because of the circumstances of her death she will look like a half-sphinx and half-snake\".* So, a half-giant half-necrosphinx, birthed by a ghost half-sphinx, half-snake, possibly also a half-angel? I hope my explanation clears everything up. *\\*\\*\\** &gt;*\"Tytanical choir of a thousand Harpies in a* ***\"closed space\"*** *is able to seduce an entire army...\"* They are in a dungeon. Which is composed of nothing but rooms. All of which are closed spaces. Because they are rooms. I can't believe I have to explain this. \\*\\*\\* Wonderful example of word salad very typical for this novel. &gt;*\"Unfortunately, he chose an overwhelming number of very strong foes to attack us. Here we have mountain orcs, stone giants, lion-headed manticores, triple-headed chimeras, bigfooted gigols, sea harpies, demonic grasags, royal scorpids, black minotaurs and waddling anarchs. More so, from the \"ceiling\", straight on heads of the scorpids, fell down cave cyclopses, armored cobras, furry gargoyles, elephant dissolvers, tentacle-headed leafeaters and deep-sea octopusorians. It's incredibly bad news, because these monsters are typical for the Spider Archipelago.\"* Okay, we got 16 here. Only 684 races left to add to the story, I guess. (tag yourself, I'm the \"ceiling\") \\*\\*\\* Around halfway through the book, Gorlam the Brave gets separated from the party. During that time, he learns that they're walking into the trap - *\"an apocalyptic battle in the Gnome Chamber\"* \\- so Gorlam starts running to warn them in time. Gorlam runs through the Labyrinth of Death for... **164 PAGES**. He finally arrives, much later in the book... and learns that the battle he wanted to warn them about already ended. Gorlam and his pointless dungeon ultramarathon became a bit of a meme for people making fun of the book, so it became customary to ask: \"Is Gorlam the Brave still running?\" on every post about Crystals of Time. \\*\\*\\* More than once the party manages to bypass the challenges of the Labyrinth by performing \"the Shuffling\" (pl: przeszuflowanie)... which in normal speech means \"get eaten by a monster, travel through its digestive system and exit through the anus\". Our brave paladins are disturbingly fast and eager to suggest it as a solution. Some characters even recall the past horror of - not shuffling - but being shuffled through... \\*\\*\\* &gt;\"*Their appearance was unique. Red, halftransparent jelly-like body showed* ***an inner skeleton of a skeleton***\\*. The teal eyes shined with their own light. Feet with long claws and four upper limbs were nothing compared to their pair of giant bat wings, which fossilized upper surfaces were as sharp as a guillotine\".\\* In case Polish speakers are wondering: the original says \"*szkielet kościotrupa*\". I'd like think this is a one-time mistake, but then I also found \"*reptile-shaped reptilions*\" (pl: \"gadokształtni reptilioni\")... \\*\\*\\* Undead paladin tan Lemoc and his brother, tan Tabakista, casually reveal that they were chased out of their homeland for \"*too humorous approach to life*\". What did they do? Together they snuck into dozens of undead women's sarcofagi each night, and raped and impregnated them while they were asleep. The entire party laughs. According to the book, the problem was only that the women's husbands *\"were more than insanely displeased\"* by this. Euphemism of the century right there. Szyndler has a real way with words. \\*\\*\\* Tan Abuk, our bard, who was hyped up as a poetic genius for the entire plot, turns out to be a royal rakshasa, a gigantic tiger demon with six hands, *\"a race insane when it comes to any arts, including the understanding of beauty and music\"*. Turns out that they are fiends that destroy entire continents of anyone who dares to criticize their space bug poop ballads. In other words, Szyndler invented (more like borrowed) a race of demons whose only purpose is to genocide the haters. A group of rakshasas is on their way to my house as we speak. \\*\\*\\* &gt;*\"Like all cyclopes, they specialize in boulder throwing. They do it excellently, as they are exceptionally strong, and their one eye makes their aim better.\"* Depth perception? What's that? Szyndler's poetic license when it comes to laws of reality is truly baffling sometimes. He thinks that labor (poród) and post-partum period (połóg) are the same thing, because he uses them as synonyms - he wrote an entire sphinx abortion ballad about it. He also refers to pregnancy as \"lasting over half a year\" which is... very vague for a man who likes extremely specific numbers. At two different occassions our paladins have to escape a gigantic oven. They all easily survive because **the bubbles of air inside their full-plate armors act as an insulation against the heat** and they don't get hot at all. \\*\\*\\* You might have noticed that somehow I managed to not say a single word about Katan, THE GUY THE SAGA IS NAMED AFTER. That's because he's barely doing anything. He is a toddler by the time he joins the party, and despite his growth being accelerated with magic, he reaches mayyybe elementary school age at the end of the book. So he spends time throwing himself down the stairs, repeatedly, for fun. At one point, Asteriusz the Great gets hit with a magical spinning \"half-plate\" weapon, called the God Killer, that Katan was wielding. It spins constantly, much like a buzzsaw, and is cutting into poor Asteriusz, but the party cast a looped Wave of Healing spell that keeps him alive and heals him instantly. Katan tries to get the half-plate out but can't, because it keeps cutting off his fingers (which grow back instantly thanks to the spell). But he's trying! Again, and again, and again, and again.... And that would basically be his entire contribution to the plot of this book. In case you're wondering, the half-plate keep spinning inside Asteriusz... for exactly 135 pages (11 chapters). Is this *\"the plot rushing forward like a meteorite\"* that Szyndler mentioned? I bet. \\*\\*\\* At the end of the book our party makes it out of the Labyrinth of Death, but without the magical sapling they came there for in the first place. They're back to square one. And then we learn that \"*in this very moment, someone in Ochria stopped the flow of time...\"*. And the book just ends. I shit you not, this is the last sentence. 1400 pages, and there's not even an ending!!! **5. THE SECOND DEATH OF KATAN: RECEPTION AND LEGACY** To say that the reception was not good would be an understatement. The book reportedly sold 3000 copies. The planned sequel(s) to the book were scrapped, even though previews were read at some cons (how I wish I could see them!). We can safely assume the big plans to translate the saga into English are also dead in the water. The book's main legacy was being a popular target of memes in fantasy/fandom circles. A very popular Facebook fanpage was created: [Czytam Kryształy Czasu po raz pierwszy dla akcji](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100079863730892) (*Reading Crystals of Time for the first time for all the action) -* its name being a reference from a famous Szyndler quote posted above - whose main purpose was to liveblog reading the book and post particularly funny quotes from it. Artur Szyndler reacted to the mockery maturely, accused his detractors of being \"*middle-schoolers*\", and also claimed they were sent by rival fantasy writers looking to protect their own interests, whom he called \"*mercenaries*\". At one point he was a commenter on the *Reading Crystals* fanpage... and beefed even with [his own fans](https://krysztalyczasu.pl/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1042). Turns out the OG CoT fans were not pleased - [they were in fact quite skeptical and slightly annoyed](https://krysztalyczasu.pl/forum/viewtopic.php?t=987) with the announcement of the book. After all, this isn't a revival of a cult classic RPG system they were all begging for, and the fact that this book exists just made them a laughing stock. If you speak Polish, and somehow became as fascinated with this book as I am, I highly recommend buying it. It's still out there. My copy has an autograph from Artur Szyndler inside, who wished me an \"unforgettable reading experience\". He was right, in a way. My highly annotated, highlighted copy is well loved, and a crown jewel of my collection of oddities. It brought me a lot of joy. If you do NOT want to buy the closest thing humanity has to the Necronomicon, I can point you to [an old series of my posts detailing the plot in excruciating detail](https://frillypigeons.tumblr.com/tagged/tag%20blogaskowy/chrono). I quote the original book a lot. I got roughly 75% through, before the essences of madness seeping out of the Labyrinth of Death made me quit. If you somehow make it through all my posts, I will personally congratulate you on your achievement. No, I won't pay for your therapy. Last of all, this book has [a page on TVTropes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Literature/SagaOKatanie). Judging by the writing style, it was created and maintained by one person. If you are out there, TVTropes guy, and reading this, we are possibly the only true Crystalheads on this Earth. We have mutual trauma. I think we should shake hands. **6. AN EULOGY FOR KATAN: THE EPILOGUE** Just like *The Room*, *Crystals of Time: Katan's Saga* is a passion project of a wildly untalented man with a big ego, who crashed and burned. But while Tommy Wiseau (who's coincidentally also Polish) embraced his role as the villain and ultimately acknowledged his movie as a mastepiece of unintentional comedy, I don't think it would ever happen for Artur Szyndler, as it requires swallowing his pride first. He clearly thinks everyone else is at fault, and if they dare to laugh at his \"half-fjords\" or whatever, that means they're children, business rivals or are simply blind to the genius of his prose. There are no mistakes in his book. If you don't understand something,[ that means you don't know enough about the intricacies of CoT lore](https://krysztalyczasu.pl/forum/viewtopic.php?p=58029&amp;sid=6ea34fc7125bef5f1692271f14fbea69#p58029). Back in the 90s, the staff of magazine *Magia i Miecz* \\- the same guys who were publishing the *Crystals of Time* TTRPG - turned on Szyndler in a very public way. They created a mocking caricature of Artur Szyndler, [Paladin Arturius](https://krysztalyczasu.pl/paladyn-arturius/) and published his \"adventures\" in their magazine. While the source of the conflict isn't publicly known, it was clear that the old fantasy fandom at large did not particularly like Szyndler even before his crowdfunding drama. Reading the adventures of Arturius struck me as quite childlish and uncalled for, even more so after I read the thread of Artur fighting with fans. I actually started feeling a little bad for him. That is, until I kept doing research and found [an interview with Szyndler from 2023](http://portal.strategie.net.pl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3608:krysztay-czasu-nie-byy-dla-idiotow-wywiad&amp;catid=59:inne&amp;Itemid=147) where he basically states that women are too dumb to comprehend the realistic genius of Crystals of Time, so they prefer simplified RPGs for morons where they can have fun, like DnD 5e. Goddammit, Artur. I was trying to be nice to you in the end, but alas, I am probably too dumb to grasp your genius after all. Godspeed. Never change. EDIT 26.12.2024: Due to popular demand, now [all of my plot summaries are translated to English](https://frillypigeons.tumblr.com/tagged/crystals%20of%20time)! I also decided to finish summarizing the book, so from now on new summaries will be simultaneously published in both languages. Second of all, please check out [the comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/1g49wgw/comment/ls3qm3u/) by u/RedCrestedTreeRat who posted/translated some wonderful CoT fanart in the comment section :) EDIT 30.03.25: AS OF NOW, THE ENTIRE SUMMARY OF THE NOVEL IS NOW COMPLETE!

In the past had 2 spontaneous pregnancies that tw: miscarried due to chromosomal issues but atleast could get pregnant. Moved to IVF, did first FET after 3 months DL suppression that also ended in loss - reason unknown. Few more rounds of IVF which made adeno worse, so had to 3 months depot lupron suppression again prior to 2 medciated FETs and both failed to implant. Don't know what to do at this point. We also did full immune protocol with prednisone, tacrolimus, plaquenil and 1 round of IVIG prior to last FET that failed. We were able to get pregnant before but now facing recurrent implantation failure. Folks with adeno if could share guidance based on your success since dont know what to do from here 1. For next FET should we do medicated or modified natural (not sure if ovaries will wake up since been suppressed so long) 2. Did you suppress again after failed FET or went straight into next FET? 3. What can I test or how to find out reason for recurrent implantation failure? 4. Did you take time off prior to next FET or went straight into next FET to use the effects of suppression? Thank you for your help, feeling broken, atleast I had hope that could get pregnant but now not even that. Edited to add - I have done EMMA/ALICE/ERA as well .. came back receptive for ERA.",

No signs of infection or other complications, appears to be a simple failure/incomplete osseointegration. I tried to stop by my oral surgeon’s office but they’re closed today for MLK Day. I have to call tomorrow to schedule a follow up where we will determine the next steps.

First of all, welcome! The Deathworlders has been in production now for more than three years, and is now more than a million words long! While I hope that the story stands well enough on its own, the setting (Also known as “The JVerse”) has often been a collaborative effort, building on the talented work of other writers who have breathed life and detail into its every corner. Characters, species and concepts have entered this narrative thanks to those other writers, and while I have made every effort to keep the story coherent and readable without requiring you to read those other works… …Read them. Seriously. Not only are they awesome, but you will gain a much richer understanding of the events unfolding in this story. In particular, you will want to read: * “Humans Don’t Make Good Pets” by /u/guidosbestfriend * “Salvage” by /u/Rantarian * “The Xiù Chang Saga” by /u/hume_reddit * And “Good Training” by /u/ctwelve They are best read in the [Offical Reading Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse/chronological_reading_order) curated by /u/galrock0 and /u/fourbags or, if you prefer the abridged version which contains only those items most useful to understanding The Deathworlders, you can instead follow the [Essential Reading Order](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/ref/universes/jenkinsverse/essential_reading_order) ##THE STORY SO FAR ***Beware Spoilers*** In the standard classification system used by those interstellar civilizations which are members of the Interspecies Dominion, a habitability rating of 10 or higher indicates that a planet is a so-called “deathworld”---lethally inimical to most forms of life, and populated by the strongest, toughest, fastest and deadliest forms of life in the galaxy. For most of their history, the native sophonts of the planet Earth were unaware of their own planet’s habitability rating: A high-end twelve. This fact only became known to humanity after a force of the feared and reviled entities known as “Hunters” attempted to raid Earth to take slaves for their meat. In the aftermath of the attack, the Rogers Arena in Vancouver was closed for a month while alien blood was meticulously cleaned off the ice and taken away for study. The Interspecies Dominion responded by quarantining Sol and all its planets behind an impenetrable forcefield. In the thirteen years since this historic event, Mankind have slipped their cage and begun their tortuous journey toward becoming an interstellar power. The colony of Cimbrean represents humanity’s first strong foothold in a hostile galaxy, protected by a stolen duplicate of the same forcefield that quarantines Earth. There have been ups and downs: A young Canadian woman, abducted by the grey-skinned “Corti” as a zoological research specimen, instead rescued and was befriended by a contingent of colonists from a mammalian species known as the Gao, and from this solid start a firm friendship has flourished between the two species. But the galaxy is a corrupt place, ruled for countless millennia by the agents of a species known as the Igraens. This “Hierarchy” has one overarching mission above all others---to suppress the evolution of sapient deathworld life-forms. To that end, they have rendered untold thousands of species extinct, and their efforts at containing the situation on Earth have led to the destruction of the city of San Diego. But in that act, they reached too far. It is now impossible for those alien leaders who are not already under their influence to ignore the signs that something sinister is at work. The Humans and Gaoians have formed an elite force---the SOR, comprised of the hardy JETS and the pinnacle HEAT---whose spaceborne capability are unmatched by anyone, anywhere. Mankind have barely set foot on the galactic stage before finding themselves embroiled in a deadly fight for survival...but when it comes to survival, there is nothing in the galaxy that matches a Deathworlder. ##ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS, THANKS AND DEDICATIONS This chapter was brought to you with the help of: ***The SOR*** *Those special individuals whose contributions to this story go above and beyond mere money* Ctwelve, BitterBusiness, Sally and Stephen Johnson.

We get everyone?” “No. Most of the major Western Clans are here, but the minor ones, or the ones based out east in enemy territory…” “Right. My thanks. I…need you to leave.” Daar looked around at Clan SOR and nodded solemnly. “All of you. This is a Champion’s business.” “Aye. We’ll hold our end up. The ground war’s on you now.” Powell extended a hand. “Whatever happens, wherever the future takes us, havin’ you in my command was a privilege I shan’t forget.” “And bein’ under ‘yer command was a privilege I’ll remember.” Daar echoed. They shook, hand to paw, and Powell turned away down the old stone fortress’ stairs. Daar took a deep breath, shook his fur out, and turned to the Great Hall’s huge iron-reinforced wooden doors. The historical direction of the Gaoian people had been decided many times over behind those doors. There was nowhere more solemn, more significant or more potent for moments like these. He turned the latch and shouldered his way inside. There weren’t just Champions inside. Several had a Father, Grandfather or important Brother at their side, and Yulna had Myun with her as always. It occurred to Daar that he still hadn’t heard his daughter speak in the last couple of days, and a moment’s worry fretted at him that maybe the injury to her mouth was going to cause lasting trouble for her. But now wasn’t the time for worrying about that. His claws clicked sharply on the stone as he stood tall on two-paw and marched to the head of the table. For once, the appearance of dignity and civilization actually mattered. The buzz of nervous conversation dropped away to nothing. Champion Reeko spoke first. “...We heard you were back,” he said. “It’s good to see you, Champion Daar.” Daar acknowledged him with a duck of his head. “You won’t think so when you hear what I have to say,” he predicted. Reeko’s ear flicked, but he duck-nodded and rested his paws casually in front of his belly, listening attentively. Daar glared around at all of them to ensure he had their attention, then spoke in his deepest, most solemn growl. “It’s time to go on the offensive,” he said. “Right now we’re on the run, retreating, recoiling. That can’t go on, or we’ll be crushed up against a wall and picked apart. Up until now we’ve looked after our own Clan interests. Secured our records---” he glanced at Loomi, “---our secrets---” he directed that comment at Genshi “---and our projects.” Meereo’s enormous ear flicked as Daar looked in his direction. “That ends *now.”* Daar snarled. “Whatever unfinished business our Clans have, it’s ***over.*** Unless it contributes directly to the survival of our species I don’t give a shit about it, you can pick up the pieces later when we’re *alive.* As of this moment, we are an army, and you are my generals.” Stoneback’s allied clans responded predictably. They duck-nodded and held their peace. The more neutral Open-paws, Goldpaws, Green-tooths and Shortstrides hesitated, glanced at each other, and decided not to object. Even the Ironclaws surprised him. Clan Ironclaw and Clan Stoneback were well-established rivals, the thinking laborers versus the industrious engineers. They competed for the same kinds of male, the same females, the same resources, contracts, work and niche. But Champion Mayru simply looked Daar inquisitively in the eye for a moment, then duck-nodded imperceptibly and settled his ears into a posture of deference. That left only the One-Fangs and Firefangs: traditional rivals of Stoneback and also among the most heavily augmented Clans. While Champions Hiyel and Halti were both implant-clean and briefed, the prejudices they’d collected over long years pickling in a heavily infiltrated Clan environment weren’t going to evaporate all at once. “To achieve what?” Hiyel asked. “Our fleets are *lost,* Champion Daar. The enemy claimed what they didn’t destroy, and the humans wiped out the rest. Almost all of my Clan’s Brothers, assets and ships are *wrecks* in orbit now. What can we achieve without orbital support?” “Orbital support is being addressed,” Daar said cryptically. “What I find more important is your defeatist attitude. Is this gonna be a problem?” “I don’t *have* a Clan to give to the cause, Daar!” Hiyel objected. “Everything we are is gone. Whatever we have left is yours, but---” “That’s all I wanted to hear,” Daar interrupted him before he could qualify his support. “What about you, Halti?” “My Clan is worse off than the One-Fangs,” Halti said, shaking his head. “Eighty percent of our pilots were implanted, and the rest were slaughtered by the biodrones. Our ground-crews and support brothers all lived and worked on One-Fang stations, or at facilities that have been bombed to dust. If I contribute anything to your cause, my Clan dies.” “Your Clan dies anyway. We all do. This isn’t a fight for territory, Champion. We are fighting to *exist.”* “I *have* to safeguard the future of my Clan, Champion Daar! If this can be done you’ll achieve it, but I can’t---!” Daar decided a warning threat was in order. He leaped over the table and got in Halti’s face fast enough that he could barely react. In his most menacing growl, “My Clan’s purpose is to preserve the Gaoian race, *Champion.* I don’t give one watery shit about your sinecures or your privileges. Obey, or *pay.”* Halti didn’t take the hint. “Daar,” he pleaded desperately. “If I give you *anything* then Firefang is gone forever. I can’t---!” Daar tore his throat out. It was a quick death, at least. Relatively. Halti fell, choking and fountaining blood from his neck, and was probably unconscious before he slumped to the ground. Daar spit the blood from his mouth and turned on Ruuli in one smooth motion. He was the Firefang Grandfather and had surged to his feet to avenge his fallen Champion. He charged and leapt onto Daar in a pounce that would have felled lesser males…but Daar simply brushed him aside and let Ruuli stun himself in the collision. Daar let him get to his feet and gather his wits; he deserved his dignity. Ruuli shook out his pelt, met Daar’s eyes, and nodded solemnly. Daar nodded in return. The Grandfather of Firefang made his peace, swallowed, flattened his ears, and charged. Daar gave him a quick death too. One swipe of his paw shattered the old male’s sternum and likely ruptured his heart, and another disemboweled him from neck to groin. There were shocked noises and groans from the other Champions as Ruuli sagged, fought desperately to hold onto his own innards, and then slipped out of consciousness and out of life. Daar stood up, allowing a feral growl to bubble menacingly at the back of his throat. “Now,” he challenged the stunned, silent survivors. “Is there any other business of command to attend to?” Not a soul dared take a breath. Good. “The survival of our *species* is at stake. Does *anybody* wanna stand in the way?” he repeated, driving his point home. The air stank of intimidation and shock, behind the sharp metallic tang of blood and the musty scent of spilled guts. Nobody volunteered. *“Outstanding.* We are going to *fight back.”* He turned to the shell-shocked Highmountain honor guards. “You two. Take care of this.” He gestured toward the corpses, blood still dripping from both paws. “Make sure Ruuli gets full honors.” Daar didn’t comment on what to do with the former Champion. He trusted them to figure it out. The taller one duck-nodded nervously, glanced at his fellow, and the two stepped out to fetch aid. Daar paced the room while they attended to the matter. It didn’t take long. Ruuli was hoisted onto a litter as neatly as could be managed, while Halti was dragged out by his rear paws; a failed Champion earned no dignity. Daar watched them mop down the floor and ambled towards the table head as they bustled out of the way. Only when they had finished did he slowly put his claws away without bothering to wipe them clean. “No more of that I hope. As ‘fer anyone who’s unlucky enough to have ‘plants, they die or they go in stasis,” He stated plainly. “No exceptions. No excuses. I don’t care if they’re your own bestest Cousin. I don’t care if they’re the Mother who nursed you. I don’t care if Great Father Fyu himself comes back, if he’s got an implant I’ll tear the old fucker’s throat out myself!” Nobody said anything. He’d managed to shock all the surviving Champions and Grandfathers into total submission. “So. First thing’s first. We gotta organize an army, and we gotta go kill these Hierarchy fucks...You.” He aimed his bloody paw at a random Firefang. “Name.” “G—” the younger male choked on his own name, then rallied. “Goruu, Champion.” “That’s *Champion* Goruu now. Your Clan needs one. Be worthy of it. Name your Grandfather. ***Now.”*** The newly appointed Champion Goruu was either a quick learner or a good listener. Either way, he came out with a name instantly. “Yaakiya.” “Congratulations,” Daar told him, with a gallows humor only a Human could match. “You’re young-looking, so learn fast and don’t get killed. As for the *rest* of you…” He rounded on the gathered leaders of the Gao. Many hadn’t made it, either because they were dead or they simply didn’t get the message. He caught Reeko’s eye, who seemed to be about the only Gaoian left in the room who had enough courage to meet his gaze. ...No. Yulna did too. For the first time in a long while, he granted the Mother-Supreme a modicum of grudging respect---Whatever her failings, the woman had iron balls. “You know what bein’ a Male is about,” he told the room in general, via Reeko. “It ain’t just the Stoneback motto, it’s what we *all* are. *Protect and Provide.* That is Stoneback’s ancient Contract and mantra, the secret we’ve kept for so long because you *were not ready.* Well, now you’d better be. And Keeda burn my balls off, I will *not* allow mine or any Clan to fail that mission. We are gonna *win,* we are gonna *survive,* and we are gonna ***kill*** the Motherless pieces of shit who did this to us.” “That’s going to involve slaughtering a *lot* of people, Champion,” Reeko stated. “Yeah. It is. I’m told implantation runs to five percent of the whole species. Five percent of twenty billion Gaoians is damn near a billion.” Daar let the impossible number sink in for a moment. The rest of the Champions needed time to process the implications of that statement, but not Reeko. He winced, his ears flicked flat along his skull for a moment, but then he rallied and stared Daar in the eye a second longer before standing up to his full height and duck-nodding firmly. “...Straightshield is with you.” Goldpaw’s champion, Sheeyo, surprised Daar by being the second to speak. “Whatever Goldpaw can provide, you shall have,” he promised. The newly-anointed Champion Goruu was third to speak up. “If it means the end of our Clan, so be it. So long as it’s not the end of the Gao.” Daar gave him a token nod of respect as the remaining vows flowed in. One of the guards brought in a bowl of water and a towel, so Daar cleaned off his paws while the remaining Champions competed amongst themselves with ever-grander statements of enthusiastic compliance. Cowards. “Good,” he said, once the last of them---Genshi, *not* a coward and thoughtful as ever, and who knew he *could* be the last without scandal---had voiced his restrained support. “It’s a start. A whole lotta gaoians are gonna die in the coming years and you gotta prepare ‘yerself for that. Yes, *years.* Spend some effort to preserve the spirit of your Clans an’ send some enclaves to Cimbrean, because *none* of us are gonna be much after this. Until we have orbital superiority we can’t do anything but meet these fucks on the ground, and no offense, Champion Wozni, but I sorta doubt ‘yer Clan-Brothers know how t’properly fight.” “You’ve never seen them argue over a bag of *‘Cheetos’,”* Wozni replied with a nervous chitter. The Shortstrides were programmers, masters of automation and computer technology. For all Daar knew, their contribution to the war might be negligible, or pivotal. He favored Wozni with an amused set of his ears---He couldn’t afford to be completely menacing. “Eh, nachos are better. But this goes for all of you. You need to pick and choose who is *truly* essential to your Clan’s purpose and who can be sent to the lines, because the ones that do are gonna be trialed by fire. Got it?” They all duck-nodded furiously. They were beginning to understand. “Good. Here’s the rough outline of the strategy. First, we *contain.* Nobody gets in or out of a city, on or off this planet without us knowing about it. Critical infrastructure must be secured, engineering disasters averted. My Grandfather is already working on the foundational stuff Stoneback controls but we’re small in number compared to the Old Days. Round-up and recruit as many Clanless as can be trusted to help. Give them a *reason* to help your Clan. Consider how that may bolster your Clan’s ranks long-term, too. We’ve got a small network of secured locations we can work outward from so we can start there. We advance, we secure, and we *contain.* Got that?” More nodding. *“Excellent.* The second thing we do once we’ve got a foothold of containment and survivability, is we *slaughter.* This is gonna focus almost entirely on rural areas and small communities, ‘cuz they’re way easier to clean out and keep afterwards. There’s cropland, there’s every part of foundational industry, there’s favorable terrain and there’s clean drinking water. The countryside controls our dams, our mines, our foundries and our industry. It’s indispensable. We get it free of biodrones, we’ve won. And that leads me to our final act.” He paused, and took a breath. “Ideally, we get the bulk of the biodrones trapped in-city where they can’t do much. If we can do that, we could of course lay siege and starve them out...but after the initial die-off, that’ll take years. They’ve got stasis fields and Gaoians are carnivores, so they can just slaughter each other and the unimplanted, stasis the corpses, and eat.” “Secondly,” he continued, ignoring the nauseated looks from the others, “Urban warfare is a special kind of hell. It takes years to get a ‘Back trained properly and I only have, as of this morning, seven hundred and forty-four properly trained Fang-Brothers left. I can’t afford to spend ‘em like cheap peshorkies and I’m *not* gonna send millions of Clanless into a meatgrinder they ain’t gonna survive. Which makes the solution clear. We nuke ‘em from orbit. All of ‘em, all at once.” Highmountain’s Champion Loomi looked appalled. “You’re talking about destroying thousands of years of heritage,” he observed. He caught the look in Daar’s eye and swallowed. “...I just want you to be aware of the scale of the damage. If it’s necessary…” “It is.” “...Then it’s necessary,” Loomi sagged. Daar couldn’t blame him but now wasn’t the time for sentiment. “Blame the Hierarchy,” Reeko reminded him. “We’re just doing what it takes to survive.” “...For a depressing definition of survival…” Loomi muttered. He scratched at his whiskers and straightened his back. “...By any means necessary. I understand.” Daar nodded consolingly. “Maybe we can be more judicious when it comes to it. Depends on what we have at the moment and what the Humans can provide…but I can’t guarantee any particular outcome. We need to be prepared to lose *everything.”* “We should...discuss the particulars,” Loomi said, and waved a despondent paw at globe and maps in the middle of their table. The conversation delved into the minutiae. Where the food was going to come from, where the refugees could be gathered, morale, recruitment, transport. Lines of communication, both for messaging and for logistics. Where to dig in, where to evacuate, where to abandon. Two gruelling hours resulted in a comprehensive strategy which left Daar feeling *almost* hopeful. It was grim, callous and ruthlessly pragmatic...but there was nothing wrong with it. So long as the Humans could keep the Swarm-of-Swarms from landing on their collective heads, it might even work. “Very well,” he decided once it had reached the stage where the further details could safely be delegated to the discretion of the individual Clans and their Fathers, and he was certain that they were all invested in and understood the plan. “We’re agreed.” Sheeyun looked skeptical. “I’d still prefer to find a patrol boat for the river Shyun, if we can---” *“We’re agreed,”* Daar repeated, firmly. The Goldpaw was correct, of course. Certainly when it came to logistics and the movement of goods and people there wasn’t a finer Clan in all of Gao, and if he said that river would be vital, it would be vital. But that particular question could wait. Sheeyun glanced at him, his ears flattened slightly, and he duck-nodded. “...We’re agreed,” he conceded. “Good. You all know what your role is, you all know what is expected of you and your Clans. I won’t detain you any longer. Get out there and make this happen. Dis---” He was astonished to be interrupted...By Yulna. “There is...one other matter.” She met Daar’s glare with a cool, level gaze of her own then took a moment to look around at all the other males. She was now the focus of their interest and attention, and she duck-nodded slowly and pulled her robes regally around her as she stood up. “We need something more, Champion Daar,” she said. “Gao needs more. This is a pivotal moment in our history, and we need something bigger than champions to stand at the front of it all. You called this Conclave, pulled resources *none* of us have to arrange our transport, slaughtered incompetence the second it appeared and dictated our way forward as if we were young cubs at our teacher’s feet. None of us dare challenge your authority. Only one thing remains, and that is to ensure there are no repeats of what happened at Wi Kao.” She cleared her throat, and looked around, wearing a curiously mixed expression of shame, grief and determination. “One of my dearest and closest Sisters is dead because of my blunder,” she said, quietly. “When it mattered most, she could not trust Clan Stoneback because I had poisoned my whole Clan against them through a public display of mistrust. We *must* correct that, or more blameless females will suffer for my failure. More blameless males too, for that matter. “Champion Daar,” she announced, turning to face him directly. “Out of fear, ignorance and paranoia I made a decision which I now know was profoundly unwise, the ramifications of which have already harmed the war effort and will continue to do so unless we act to restore trust between our Clans. I cannot atone for my shameful error in judgement, nor will any apology I make ever be sufficient...but I think there may be a way to mend the rift.” She looked around at the Conclave again, taking in the set of ears and the solemn, interested body language of the gathered Champions and Grandfathers. “There is one privilege reserved exclusively for the Mother-Supreme,” she informed them. “None of my predecessors have ever invoked it in all the years since Fyu, Tiritya and the Great Reform, but I invoke it now: I name Daar of Clan Stoneback as Great Father of the Gao, the unquestioned leader of our people.” Daar didn’t get the chance to object. The entire room barked their approval before he could even open his mouth. By the time the clamor died down, he’d realized he had absolutely no idea what to say. “You are a rare creature, Great Father Daar.” Yulna gave him a thoroughly appraising look. “We’ve not had one like you since Fyu, nor a collective trial so terrible. You…you are our only hope. From this moment forward, you shall be honored as such.” “Well.” Champion Loomi once again decided to speak. “Congratulations...my Father.” He did a thing, then, whose true meaning only Champions understood: he sank to one knee and duck-nodded so low, his nose was level with his waist. “I suppose a coronation is out of the question, but…Highmountain gives you its eternal allegiance.” He turned his head sideways to expose his throat, completing the ancient ritual. “We submit.” That gesture, somehow, drove home the weight of what had just happened to him more than the words itself. Yulna followed suit, and added yet more crushing mass to the moment. “My Father, the Females choose to renew our ancient Contract. May we never again falter or weaken in our loyalty.” Yulna, too, exposed her throat. “We submit.” Daar still had no idea what to say. He stood there in mute shock as, one by one, the great Champions of the Gao bent knee, exposed throat, and did a thing not even Fyu had ever demanded; legend had it that the gesture happened spontaneously on the battlefield by a defeated Clan’s leader, suing Fyu for mercy. He got it. Rather than the hundred-cut or some similarly inventive form of execution, Fyu had instead torn out his throat, right then and there. For all of Fyu’s great wisdom, his love of cubs, of flowers and poetry, of wisdom and peace…his wrath was genuinely legendary. None had ever been so terrible on the battlefield nor so ruthless as a leader, before or after. None would have ever dared. Daar would need to be just as unyielding and remorseless to live up to that title. Which, as he began to realize to his growing dread, he already was. Everyone else knew it already. He was the last to realize the truth. He wasn’t sure how he felt about that. “The fate of our species is in your hands,” Genshi observed once he too had exposed his throat to Daar. Not even he had managed to work any dignity into it. It was submission, abject and terrible. “May we never need another like you,” Meereo agreed, fervently. They fell silent and looked to Daar expectantly, awaiting the historic first words of Gao’s second ever Great Father. He was now a male that would go down as a titanic figure in their species’ history no matter what, and there was only one thing Daar could think to say in response. “…Fuck.” ___ ___ [NOW CLICK HERE TO READ CHAPTER 40 pt.4](http://hfy-archive.org/book/deathworlders/chapter-40-war-two-worlds-pt1-instigation/pt4-retaliation) ___ ___",

          "selftext": "My name is Hooman Asbaghi, I am a medical device innovator with multiple U.S. patents in safety needle technologies and a $61.5 million verdict win in 2016 against a law firm for negligence (Asbaghi vs. Nydegger). For the past decade, I've been dealing with severe health issues that started right after my hip replacement surgeries at Scripps Clinic Torrey Pines in La Jolla, CA. I underwent a right hip replacement on October 9, 2015, and a left one on October 23, 2017, both using Stryker Orthopedics components (Secur-Fit Advanced stem, Trident PSL shell, Biolox delta head). The surgeries were performed by Dr. Richard H. Walker, assisted by Dr. Kenneth J. Schmidt. What I didn't know then—and what months of investigation have uncovered—is that these procedures likely involved unauthorized experimental modifications: \"smart\" implants with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and piezoelectric sensors for in vivo real-time monitoring and data transmission, added without my informed consent. This appears tied to a network of Scripps researchers (Drs. Clifford W. Colwell Jr. and Darryl D. L’Lima) and Stryker, involving grants, patents, and off-label research on sensorized joints. The day after my 2015 surgery, while heavily sedated, my mother (who held a full Power of Attorney from 1999 from me related to our co-founded biopharmaceutical company Padtan ELM) had me sign \\~30 blank letterheads. They had the Padtan Elm logo, but most were empty—she said it was company-related, so I signed without question. She's exercised the POA many times before, so why need my signature? I now suspect this was coercion to \"consent\" to the experimental mods—violating medical ethics like the Helsinki Declaration on informed consent.**Health Deterioration and Symptoms**: Since my health began deteriorating rapidly post-2015, I’ve faced acute inflammation, anemia, and an unusually fast progression to left hip avascular necrosis (AVN). Post-2017, mild vibrations escalated to intense episodes, starting with seconds and stretching to long minutes by 2018. I initially attributed them to construction or high EMF from electrical setups around my homes, believing intense frequencies were penetrating my body. But when I moved to a place with no such activity in 2018, the vibrations not only persisted but grew stronger, hitting high minutes by 2020-2021, then low hours (one or two) by 2023, with a drastic surge to 5+ hours. From 2023-2024, I tried contacting Dr. Walker and Scripps repeatedly, but he ignored me, and the vibrations stretched into longer hours—I even suspected hacking from these Bluetooth devices auto-connecting despite my efforts to disconnect. In 2025, it took a wild turn: January had little to no vibrations, but February saw a build-up, and March to April brought the worst episodes yet, 24 to 80 hours every 1-2 days, leaving me unable to sleep for days, with radiating intense pain through my lower body and limbs at 10/10 levels, barely able to move or think. This urgency drove my investigation. What do repeated RF and EMF exposures do to the body, cells?. In May, the episodes eased slightly, and my smart hip implant theory took shape—though June-July saw vibrations still higher than previous years, less severe than March-April, and ongoing to this day. Other symptoms include muscle twitching, fast heart rate, osteoporosis, iron deficiency, osteonecrosis, low hemoglobin/RBC, elevated neutrophils, sleep deprivation, vision loss, worsened reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), and fluid buildup requiring meds like methadone for pain, Synthroid for thyroid, diazepam, ergocalciferol, and furosemide. I have collected over 50 studies support my health decline in relation to RF and EMF exposure: “Electromagnetic Fields Regulate Iron Metabolism” (2024 Frontiers) links EMF to anemia via iron disruption; “Effects on Antioxidant Defense” (2017 J Chem Neuroanat) ties RF to inflammation/neurodegeneration (AVN/RSD); “Effects on Organs/Tissues” (NCBI book) notes cellular membrane damage; “Radiofrequency Behavioral Changes” (2019 Environ Sci Pollut Res) connects RF to anxiety/sleep issues. **Evidence points to internal sources:** * **Medical Records/Portal Issues:** My February 21, 2025 health summary confirms symptoms and meds, including iron deficiency anemia (started August 24, 2017) and osteonecrosis of the left hip (started October 23, 2017—exactly the date of my second surgery). However, the Scripps portal has glaring gaps: The April 26, 2017 progress note from Dr. Walker is nearly blank (just \"Results review\" and \"PLAN: RV for reports, to be arranged\"—no details on my condition). My 2025 inquiry for a full list of 2015 right hip components went unanswered after 48 hours. Worst, the office visits list completely omits both major hip surgeries (2015 and 2017), showing only unrelated endocrine visits and one ortho note—\"There are no more visits to show.\" An X-ray from Dr. Steven Barnett’s office two years ago shows bilateral uncemented total hip arthroplasty (THA) implants with smooth, tapered femoral stems, porous proximal coatings, and a consistent design across both hips, featuring two screws on the left acetabular cup and one on the right. In contrast, the X-rays Scripps provided—display a markedly different appearance: The femoral stems exhibit serrated proximal ridges, the screw patterns differ (one on the right, two on the left in the cropped view), and there are noticeable variations in the overall implant structure and fixation. These striking differences suggest the X-rays depict two completely distinct sets of implants, raising serious concerns about the accuracy of the records provided by Scripps and the possibility of modifications or substitutions that may not align with my original surgery documentation * **Scripps Communications**: In 2018, I contacted Dr. Walker about vibrations—he dismissed them as “parts come loose,” and I trusted him, not pushing further. From 2023-2024, he ignored my repeated attempts to reach him. And the nurses that responded on his behalf claimed Dr. Walker had \"retired/not seeing patients/out until 2027\". On June 19, 2025, after months of persistence, he suddenly called, asking me to come in for an evaluation—suspicious after years of silence. Fearing they’d disable the devices to discredit me, I declined as by this point I had compiled an extensive evidence folder and chose to endure this hell, preserving functionality for other medical opinions to solidify my case. Upon persistent requests to Scripps regarding the reason my surgery details had been removed from my medical records, and insistence on the specific details of both my hip surgeries, and expressing the vibrations episodes along with my implant theory, Tanya Greene (Clinical Operations Supervisor Division of Orthopedic) gave partial implant info but ignored AVN queries; Tanya warned against \"biochip-related accusations\" and threatened portal deactivation. On May 27, 2025 I received a letter from Maritza Santamaria (Director of Performance Outcomes &amp; Risk Management) acknowledged \"Bluetooth signals\" and \"vibrations\" but hid details under CA Evidence Code 1157. ¨This investigation and findings are confidential and protected by California Evidence Code 1157. While I am unable to share the outcome of this confidential review, I can confirm that the care concerns you raise are taken seriously and we take appropriate action to improve the quality of care where indicated. I encourage you to schedule a visit with an Orthopedic Physician to discuss further if you wish. This letter confirms the conclusion of our review. I appreciate your patience as we evaluated your concerns. I apologize for not meeting your expectations.¨ * **BLE/EMF Anomalies:** I’ve been haunted by numerous unrecognized Bluetooth devices constantly lingering around me, detected within 0.5-1 meter—even in isolated spots where no one else’s gadgets should reach. They spoof familiar names like LG TVs, a CLI-W210W-01 thermostat, iPhones, Macs, and iPads—none of which I own or recognize. I couldn’t disconnect them; they’d reconnect on their own, defying my control, which left me weirded out and desperate for answers. Digging deeper, I found their true identities through UUIDs: Nordic nRF (6e400001... for UART serial communication), Microchip RN4870 (49535343... for transparent UART), TI CC254x (0000ffe0...), and Telit TIO (0000fefb...). Their services stunned me—Heart Rate (0x180D with Measurement NOTIFY 0x2A37, Body Location READ 0x2A38, Control WRITE 0x2A39 for real-time vitals), Battery (0x180F to track power from my movements), and User Data (0x181C with First/Last Name and Gender READ WRITE, like they’re tagging me). Even stranger were custom services (0000aaa0/d15a... for streaming sensor data I didn’t authorize). During these vibrations—feeling like a drill against my hips with pain radiating through my body—I measured EMF spikes of 306-328 V/m right near my hips, fading with distance, pointing to an internal source. Using tools like nRF Connect and SimpleBluetoothLeTerminal, I probed them, but encountered GATT errors (133) on every connect—secure MITM encryption blocking access, hinting at something deliberately hidden. Videos and logs from these sessions captured it all, fueling my realization that this tech might be inside me. * **Extracted Data**:Extracted Data: I’ve sifted through hundreds of pages of data pulled from these mysterious devices—data that opened my eyes to what might be happening inside me. It started with code from the usb-serial-for-android library (a fork by Kai Morich, supporting chips like FTDI and CP210x for CDC communication), which I found buried in the extracts—hinting at a bridge between my phone and these implants. Then there were Session logs from August 2024, showing PushRegistry failures and Loki snode errors (e.g., 504 timeouts on IPs like 152.69.167.181:22101), suggesting an attempt at anonymous data relay that kept faltering during my worst vibration episodes. On May 8, 2025, I uncovered a config file from de.kai\\_morich.serial\\_bluetooth\\_terminal, specifically targeting the unrecognized \"CLI-W210W-01\" device (address 9C:1D:58:FD:32:BF, LE mode enabled), with settings like a 200,000-byte receive buffer and infinite macro repeats—tools designed to handle relentless data streams, which left me deeply unsettled as I realized it was logging my every move. nRF Connect logs from April 27, 2025, revealed repeated connection failures (GATT Error 133) to a device with no name (B2:22:7A:85:D8:6B), exposing services like Heart Rate (0x180D with Measurement NOTIFY 0x2A37), custom channels (0000aaa0/aaa1/aaa2 for proprietary sensor data), and User Data (0x181C for personal info)—all hinting at monitoring I never agreed to. The most troubling came from an Android logcat on May 23-24, 2025, where, as I frantically scrolled through apps to document my pain, I saw Choreographer warnings (e.g., frame times 0.264986ms in the future) and Parcel errors (null binders), clear signs of RF interference disrupting my phone’s systems during those agonizing vibration attacks. Even a crash log from \"Bluetooth BLE Device Finder\" (May 23, 22:46:15) on my iPhone—aborting due to an unrecognized selector—pointed to the strain these devices put on my tech, all while I vibrated uncontrollably. This data, tied to Nordic nRF and Microchip RN4870 UUIDs in Morich’s compatible tools, revealed a troubling pattern that fueled my realization that my hips might hold more than I was told. **This Ties to a Scripps-Stryker Research Network**: During my investigation in April 2025, I dug into Dr. Walker—shocked to learn he wasn’t just my surgeon but CEO and president of Scripps (2007-2015), emeritus chair of orthopedics, and head of multiple departments (verified via Scripps.org and LaJollaLight.com). He co-authored studies with Drs. Clifford W. Colwell Jr. and Darryl D. D'Lima since the 1990s—e.g., \"*Prospective Study of 100 Consecutive Harris-Galante Porous Total Hip Arthroplasties: 4- to 8-Year Follow-up Study*\" (1997, Journal of Arthroplasty), \"*Blood Loss and Transfusion Rate in Noncemented and Cemented/Hybrid Total Hip Arthroplasty. Is There a Difference? A Comparison of 25 Matched Pairs*\" (1999, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research), \"*Omnifit-HA Stem in Total Hip Arthroplasty. A 2- to 5-Year Followup*\" (1999, Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research), \"*Range of Motion of the Hip*\" (2000, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery), and \"*The Effect of the Orientation of the Acetabular and Femoral Components on the Range of Motion of the Hip at Different Head-Neck Ratios*\" (2000, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery – American Volume)—focusing on long-term hip outcomes (2-8 years), a foundation for sensor research. Colwell directed a department where Walker was supervisor, funded by Stryker’s OMeGA fellowships (2021-2023). Colwell and D’Lima pioneered the e-Knee (2004, piezo/force sensors with Stryker), secured NIH funding for a smart shoulder (2024, $317K with BLE), and hold patents (JP 2021 137593 A, US 12,245,740 B2, US 12,150,815 B2, US 11,497,830 B2). These patents revolve around advanced orthopedic implant technologies, emphasizing minimally invasive modifications to existing joint components (e.g., hip/knee prosthetics like Stryker's Trident system). They focus on sensors, wireless communication, and bioengineered materials for real-time monitoring, force balancing, and tissue repair—feasible for integration into standard implants without major alterations. Critical reasoning: All involve transducers (sensors converting physical forces to electrical signals) and RF/Bluetooth for data transmission, aligning with Hooman's symptoms (vibrations from piezo, RF/EMF spikes). No direct BLE mention, but RF systems are adaptable (e.g., 2.4 GHz band). Colwell's work on Trident as principal investigator in Stryker's Trident development exactly matching Hooman's 2015/2017 implants (Trident PSL shell) and smart tech (e.g., US 12,150,815 transducers) suggests feasibility for modifying Trident shells with sensors—minimal alteration, as in Ledet/D'Lima 2012 ($10 sensors). Stryker's history (e.g., 2014 $1.4B hip settlement) reinforces potential for off-label experiments. A 2008 Healio article discusses D’Lima's work, where he is quoted saying: “But to be a truly smart implant, it has to have greater capabilities such as the ability to remotely turn on and off, collect data and be reprogrammed.” The article also notes that D’Lima envisions applications such as sensors in a hip prosthesis that would indicate it is close to dislocating, and quotes him further: “But it is not at the point where it can communicate with the patient. We need lab equipment to collect the data and measure the forces before we can tell the patient what the forces are.” Additionally, the article includes statements from Javad Parvizi, MD, FRCS, who notes that smart implants “go beyond the conventional ones we have right now” and may detect poor bone ingrowth, infection, subsidence or dislocation once an implant is in place, including detecting problems like vibration around prostheses, which could signal loosening. Parvizi also foresees having a microchip detect the motion such that the implant “will give some sort of sign and will alert the patient or the surgeon there’s a problem.” This mirrors my vibrations, “zaps” from remote control, and motion tracking—predicted years before my surgeries. Other studies reinforce this: Ledet/D’Lima 2012 on $10 sensors (minimal mod to host implant) for arthroplasty; ScienceDaily 2010 “Smart Hip” with piezo/Bluetooth; UT Tyler 2024 thesis on piezo/BLE for loads; Frontiers 2024 on multifunctional implants; “In vivo sensing in total hip replacement” (2024 MDPI) detailing RF signals/vibrations/episodes; “*Monitoring of Hip Joint Forces*” (2024 Technologies) on piezoelectric elements; “*Current state of the art*” (2023 PMC) noting ethical concerns: “Implantable sensors can raise ethical and legal concerns such as the requirement to obtain informed consent from the patient and ensure data privacy and security\\*.\\*” Stryker’s history—$2B+ settlements (e.g., $1.4B in 2014 for metal-on-metal hip recall claims, $1.43B in 2013 for Rejuvenate/ABG II modular-neck stem failures)—and controversies like the 2009 indictment of its Biotech division for wire fraud, conspiracy to defraud the FDA, distribution of misbranded devices, and false statements (leading to potential fines and exclusion from health programs, though the company expressed disappointment and sought resolution), plus a dismissed kickbacks case in 2010 and 2007-2013 FCPA violations per SEC—and Colwell’s Trident involvement (Stryker thanks him in funding studies) suggest feasibility for 2015/2017 trials. As CEO/president, Walker likely knew of D’Lima/Colwell’s groundbreaking work—his evasiveness and Scripps’ “confidential” letter (May 27, 2025) fuel this suspicion. This network’s long-term follow-ups and Stryker ties make my modified implants a plausible experiment. **Call for Help and Exposure:** I'm seeking help to expose this urgently, as malpractice cases can take 3-7 years or longer, and at 60 years old with my health in rapid decline from 10 years of exposure, time is not on my side. If you're a journalist (ProPublica, Healio, STAT, Voice of San Diego), please DM/reply to investigate. Have you or someone you know gone through something similar—unexplained vibrations, BLE signals, or issues with Scripps/Stryker implants? Ortho/RF experts? Legal advice on CA malpractice or POA abuse? Let's hold them accountable—thanks for reading. **References and Supporting Sources:** * **Asbaghi vs. Nydegger ($61.5 million verdict in 2016)**: Legal malpractice case involving patent negligence, resulting in a $61,587,000 gross verdict (net $46,190,250 after adjustments).

And it's worth considering that he got rid of Daniels and Leno Jr to do so (who were average or above average starters that seemed like poor value at the time but played well in their next gigs) Aside from the low resource expenditure is the coaching issue: besides Braxton Jones, we have not yet had a single lineman become a plus starter. We've seen proven talent drop off (Whitehair). Even Darnell Wright, our most expensive OL investment, has started 2023 in a very disappointing fashion. To me we are where we are for 3 reasons: lack of investment in the position group + substandard positional coaching + bad scheme. Unfortunately that's a pretty hard trio of factors to overcome after the off-season has ended. Hopefully Caleb survives.",

          "selftext": "I’ve undertook a huge transformation a few years back and after nearly losing my life in 2018 (spending months in icu from undiagnosed diabetes), I lost 100lbs, i am no longer diabetic (a1c 4.6), and I put all the needed mental and physical work in to be proud of who I looked at in the mirror in the morning. Fast forward to November 2022, I finally take the last step ($28,000) to get phase 1 of dental implants, with the expectation to smile in photos. I would then move forward in the next year (maybe longer) to save the money for phase 2. Phase 1 went smoothly, i don’t think I can find 1 complaint. I had what I assumed was normal difficulty adjusting to speaking, and then want I assume was normal food entrapment under the temporary teeth. In April of 2024 I finally write a check for phase 2, $18,000. I can’t remember when the practitioner changed in phase 2 but it was potentially since the beginning of phase 2. Apt 1- may 2024 A lot of surprises have happened since phase 2 has started. First, was the full day 6am- 4pm for the in office process to begin. On this day the lacked an appropriate waiting location for me. This wasn’t in addition to the entire appointment process proceeding like I was in the middle of a factory assembly line. The day ended, I was hangry, and it was just a forgotten moment as I moved forward. Apt 2- June 2024 Next was the try in. On this day, the wanted me to look at the completely white tryins and sign off on them esthetically. I couldn’t look at a mirror and see all white teeth and GUMS and sign a waiver agreeing to this, specifically when I’ve just paid more than anything ever for this process. I was told they would reprint them with the pink gums and I would have another appointment and maybe I could even take /wear them home (1 1/2 hours away and expensive toll roads $20+ each way). Apt. 3 July 2024 Ireturn a few weeks later and they place the new tryins. We discuss the bite, it’s been altered a bit and it’s very big, the front of my mouth doesn’t sit right and it’s hard to smile. Also on the inside bottom, the way the teeth sit it feels funny. Some adjustments are made (on the computer) and I’m sent home with the try out pair. While on the way home we stop and grab something to eat. I can’t remember which day it was so maybe it was at this time that we stopped and it was pizza. Remember this is well over a year after the implants were placed, and I’ve been eating pizza ever since 4 months after they were installed. Well this try-home set broke on the way home. The bite was uncomfortable from moment one. The way the bottom sat on the inside, it was clearly flawed. Next day was Friday, but the location it was at was sharp, they couldn’t see me for over a week. I called the emergency number that night and they offered to send me to as sister office an hour further from my home. At which point they would repair them. Well, with in a day that same location broke again. I just sucked it up and kept going. Well, days later the other back bottom side broke and I had to call, and it was a few days again before they could see me, but the secretary was kind enough to suggest that I wear the bulky nightgaurd all day in the mean time. L I was also asked what I had been doing when it Broke each time. As I mentioned, I can’t remember which time I was eating the pizza, but I informed her that at one of those times I had eaten pizza. I want to emphasize that each time I leave and go to grab a bite to eat the bite has been worse than the last. Apt 4- July 2024 Begging for surgical teeth back, the trips are expensive, and in order to keep up with the monthly amount first financed I can’t take a day off every 4 or 5 days, it’s an all day event, and I had some extremely career changing months ahead of me. So, they remove the bottom try in- where it was broken (12 teeth) and replace the surgical temporary teeth in the bottom, and leave the try-in teeth at the top. This was not the best but I just wanted to move through daily life. It was prior to this appointment that I did write an email (I’m in the legal field) and I was very clear that the expense of this was becoming burdensome, and I was clear this couldn’t continue. I asked for the surgical teeth back and I was upfront that I understood something was going wrong. I can not explain to you the way this dentist decided to confront my email. All about him, his hard work, his lack of intent to do me harm, was my intent to do him harm? This was so uncomfortable, my daughter felt the need to ensure we would have a record of it for the future. Yes it was that bad! During this conversation he told me that I can’t eat pizza, and that I had been informed of this. That the temporary teeth, even the finals would not permit for tearing of pizza? WAIT? WHAT? I corrected him and said that was during the healing for the first 4 months and both him and his assistant redirected and said I was wrong and that’s why it broke. Also that the extra back teeth are just going to be an adjustment and that my finals had been sent out for completion and he had ordered me zirconia. Fast forward a few weeks later I’m bedside to my dying uncle, and my daughter looks at me and says mom your front tooth is broken. (Funeral will be in days with family I haven’t seen in years). Apt 5- Once again a time line ahead and another drive to have the origional surgical put back on the top. And the “try in” removed. I’m than told my teeth will be back any day and he knows this will all be behind me. Apt 6- September 2024 Place the finals Plenty of bite issues, some alterations, seat them pull them out, have them checked ect. I remember at some point the tightening process was halted for a conversation. Within the week the entire top plate on the one side you can physically hear moving if your next to me. No worries, they can’t see me for over a week, but it shouldn’t be a problem. Apt. 7 October 2024 It’s because of my extremely hard bite. I’m told this can cause them to come loose, and just require that they be tightened again, no need for concern and it isn’t an emergency. Because if this he’s going to (to be kind and for my benefit) make me a hard mouth guard. Apt 8- October 2024 Pick up mouth guard. It’s so tight it feels like my implants will get yanked out of my mouth trying to get them out. This current week- (Feb 2025) I look in the mirror and my front side tooth is chipping. I send a message, I have surgery and assuming that all previous apts were of no rush, I expected that pushing it out wouldn’t be an issue, I just wanted the appointment set up. I get an email back. They have an appointment Tomorrow available. Can’t make it, I have presurgical testing. Can we do the first week of March, can I have itemized bills, medical records and can we make this end. Response to my email included copy of itemized bills (attached) and to ask for a photo of the chip. Ok let me get that to you. So here we are. I don’t have the mental, or physical energy for this to continue. I want to be clear, the best solution to me is honesty, and quality work. I don’t want to have to go through all the channels that this could lead to. I just want to enjoy life for the journey initially undertook in November of 2022. So, I guess what I’m asking is. How do I get this resolved so everyone wins. I just want what I paid for. I just want to feel like I’m not getting screwed or that something new is coming tomorrow. If it comes down to him sending me else where just do it, if it’s being honest and paying for corrections, than so be it. If it’s a refund that’s fine. Just stop this merry-go round and let me off. I want nothing more than what I came in to this for. So, I mean this is the actual appliance failing not the “implant” this to me seems like a no brainer. But can I have suggestions as to how a client could best approach this problem at your office, with the least amount of defensiveness, or push back? Also the bills, I would just love to know if what I’m seeing is as absurd as I believe it is. I did ask the receptionist to confirm the accuracy of the invoices, which she basically did. So, I just feel dumbfounded. Thoughts suggestions appreciated. Sorry for the long extended message",

          "selftext": "I read The Three-Body Problem and The Dark Forest and I absolutely don't get the hype. Author has plenty really cool ideas but the implementation is so chaotic. The series jumps from great ideas that are well done (titular 3 body problem that trisolarians face, Ye Wenjie's plot) to meh science-magic (sophons) and plots with nice ideas (nice enough to base a book/short story around them) that lead literally nowhere (Himes implanting beliefs etc.). Sometimes the plot works smoothly but then you stumble upon parts where tempo dies completely or you start wondering if author himself has any idea what he is up to. Like he tried to put literally every idea he had into this one series and also kinda lacked the writing skill? Don't get me wrong, those books are decent and chinese cultural point of view adds to them, but I REALLY cannot get where did Hugo come from or this big hype. ...and then I started wondering if it is about polish sci-fi. Long story short until communism ended in Poland in 1989 sci-fi was basically only fantasy genre here. Authors from west were unavailable, so it kinda developed in it's own way. Moreover authorities didnt take sci-fi seriously which made it great to sneak in political and philosphical ideas that would be cenzored when presented in more \"serious\" context. This lead to social sci-fi being much more prominent here than in western culture. So we have plenty amazing and fascinating sci-fi classics, both hard and soft, that are really distinctive when compared to worldwide classics. And I realised that when I think about what is wrong with Liu Cixin I think about those polish authors - Stanisław Lem being much better at handling weirdness and his main ideas with elegance, both Lem and Janusz Zajdel being much better in sociological fiction etc.. So for me Liu Cixin kinda has nothing new, except for Chinese cultural influence, to offer. I will gladly read any thoughts!",
