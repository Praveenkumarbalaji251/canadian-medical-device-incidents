I'm a black 24 yo, and I finally decided to listen to the Rock music that gets so much praise. Outside of 3 albums, my only experience with rock music is from video game soundtracks, movies and TV commercials. I tried to go into each one with an open mind and as blind as possible, doing research afterwards. This took 5 months to complete. Also, I chose to listen to them in a random order, as to not develop a unconscious bias for the older stuff.

1. Bob Dylan - The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan (1963): B+ [2 listens] not really rock, but still very entertaining. He's really more of a poet than a musician and the lyrics carry the whole thing, with the music not being too impressive. I set a full day aside for his discography, so I would fully appreciate his later stuff if I understood what he first sounded like

2. The Beatles - Beatles for Sale (1964) B [1 Listen] this is the only Beatles album I didn't originally listen to at the same time as the others. This feels like a more focused A Hard Day's Night, but both are just as good. I've went into more detail on each Beatles Album in another post. But this is when they start to become great

3. Bob Dylan - Bringing It All Home (1965): A- [3 listens] I actually liked the acoustic side better lol. His first big dip into electric guitar on an album, it's pretty great. After hearing his other albums, this isn't that mind-blowing, but on the first listen, I was completely captivated by the storytelling from song to song. The only time I've ever looked up the lyrics to read side by side while listening

4. The Beatles - Help! (1965): B+ [3 listens] the effort and quality is the same, but it's much more varied than AHDN. They're doing it all here, wonderfully. It's variety is what gives it a slight edge over their "touring era" albums

5. Bob Dylan - Highway 61 Revisited (1965): A++ [4 listens] The album where "the 60s officially started", this is really great. Going full electric did nothing to change the fact that he's such a great lyricist, that he can make an album with only a triangle and it'll still be great to hear him speak. Also, Like A Rolling Stone lived up the hype, the entire choruses to the harmonica is literally perfect

6. The Beatles - Rubber Soul (1965): A++ [5 listens] Ok, this is where I started to understand why they're considered the GOAT. Ginormous step up in musical ability, they were in the zone here. Apparently, this started the album era and I can see why. It's incredible from front to back

7. The Beach Boys - Pet Sounds (1966): A+ [4 listens] the 3rd album I listened to and it was WAAAY too early (after Metallica) and I was NOT accustomed to the sound yet. It was after I listened to the Beatles and understood the sound of that era, that I could properly understand it in the right context. It's probably the most consistent album I've heard, not a single bad song here. I'm glad I'm able to have respect for this album

8. Bob Dylan - Blonde on Blonde (1966): Masterpiece [5 listens] the lyricism of Highway 61 plus much better musicality from the backing band and Dylan, equals a true masterpiece. The musicianship in particular increased and truly makes the music JUST great as great the storytelling of every song.

9. The Beatles - Revolver (1966): Masterpiece [7 listens] At first I didn't like it because Rubber Soul was so good, but after repeated listens, it's fucking perfect. The mixtures of sounds and styles in just a single song is incredible, let alone great songwriting throughout (it's no longer all love songs, thank god)

10. The Beatles - Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967): MASTERPIECE [5 listens] probably the most anticipated album here, was underwhelmed at first, as this was supposed to be the GREATEST of all time. With more listens, it's so cohesive with it's style and it's time is what makes it stand out above the rest. You could hear that they were just trying to be as creative as possible

11. The Velvet Underground & Nico - Self-Titled (1967): A+ [3 listens] what a great album. Love the tone of the vocals here, matching with the unique music, particularly the guitar. Such a moody album, that teleports you to a small nightclub in the 60s, filled with smoke, where a couple of singers come to sing their emotions away on stage

12. The Beatles - Magical Mystery Tour (1967): B+ [3 listens] an actual B sides project, it's still pretty damn amazing. There's really no flow from track to track, but the quality of songs is enough to make it a great project

13. Cream - Disraeli Gears (1967): A+ [2 listens] I only knew that these guys apparently were a "super group" and that this was psychedelic rock. I had no idea that this was THE psychedelic rock album (I always assumed Sgt. Pepper's was). From front to back, consistent tone, as if I was transported to the late 60s with this record. I also assumed that because it's solely in one genre, that it'll get old after a second listen, but it got exponentially better

14. The Doors - The Doors (1967): A- [2 listen] Nice, laid back 60s rock. THIS is the sound I used to associate "60s rock" as. Pretty consistent, but no amazing highs to make it a favorite

15. The Jimi Hendrix Experience - Are You Experienced? (1967) B+ [1 listen] I understand why people say he's the best. The songs aren't really all that interesting, but what he's doing with the guitar certainly is. At times, it feels like he's just experimenting instead of making actual music, but whenever he does go off on a tangent, you're 100% into it

16. Bob Dylan - John Wesley Harding (1967): B+ [2 listen] I probably need to listen to it more to have a fully formed opinion on it, but as it stands, it's an okay project. More folk than rock which brings it down some but Bob Dylan can release a spoken word album and it'll still be great off his lyrics alone

17. The Band - Music from Big Pink (1968): A- [2 listens] I thought it was pretty presumptuous to name themselves THE Band, but nevertheless, they had a few highly rated albums. I had very low expectations and they exceeded them. Such a moody, cooled album. Also, Carry the Weight lived up to the standards

18. The Beatles - Self-Titled ("The White Album") (1968) Masterpiece [5 listens] Underwhelmed at first, with how aimless it is, but came to see the greatness of it. The opposite of Revolver, every style gets it's own song where it gets explored to it's creative peak. It felt like it was a point it how random the songs where in this album. Like most Beatles stuff, I can't explain it but it just works. Spectacular

19. Van Morrison - Astral Weeks (1968) A- [2 listens] I didn't know whether to add this because it wasn't strictly defined as rock, but "experimental." I got the absolute wrong connotation when I saw that and disliked it at first. Ended up enjoying it a bit more on a 2nd listen. It's more experimental folk than rock, with a bunch of jazz and soul influence, yet it doesn't feel messy in it's execution. Given more listens, it could grow on me

20. The Beatles - Abbey Road (1969) Masterpiece [6 listens] Underwhelmed at first. I did some digging about it and how side A and B different, and that changed EVERYTHING. The "Abbey Road Medley"... is the greatest 20 minutes of music I've ever heard in my life. I don't even want to say anything after that. But if the first half was as cohesive as the second, it would be in the "greatest piece of art ever created" status, for me. What a fucking send off

21. Creedence Clearwater Revival - Green River (1969): A+ [2 listens] probably the most blues heavy album I've heard, incredible style of rock on display. The singer-guitarist combo is also the best I've heard. So many songs popped out on the 2nd listen, like Lodi and I Wrote a Song for Everyone. Can't wait to hear their other albums!

22. The Rolling Stones - Let It Bleed (1969): B+ [3 listens] they have a very signature sound and style unique to them, but for some reason, I just don't love it that much. It was an easy listen, but aside from the first and final track, there's nothing here that stands out. Great sound tho

23. The Who - Tommy (1969): B [1 listens] A rock "musical", pretty unique to merge the two. While the songs are okay on their own, imo the story just not as interesting to warrant a double album of material. I was left wanting more of a complete, linear story, which is this severely lacked

24. Crimson King - In the Court of the Crimson King (1969): A- [1 listen] Didn't see this on any any big critic lists, but did see it a lot on Reddit. It's a great mixture of Jazz and classical music, with a rock base. It has a formless composition; favoring moments over fully fleshed out ideas. It does at times feel empty (idk if that is a common staple of "progressive rock"), but overall the good parts make up for the tonal emptiness of a good chunk of the album

25. Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin I (1969): A- [3 listens] I have heard of this band, but I had NO IDEA that they were this big or well respected (I thought they were on the same level as ACDC or Aerosmith, but with less hit songs lol). Someone said that they were "the Beatles of the 70s" and that quickly gave me some perspective. This feels like blues, but just infused with rock. Which is PERFECT with their individual members. The guitarists is incredible at riffing and freestyling, the drummer can easily switch back and forth between improving and supporting the bass guitar, while the lead has such a free flowing style, that he can easily adapt to whatever is behind him. It feels like you're in the studio with them, just hanging out, watching them freestyle on their instruments. I wish there was a bit more energy (that'll come later), but all in all, this is a great time. Also, the keys combo with the drums and bass on Your Time Is Gonna Come :)

26. Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin II (1969): A [3 listens] what a follow-up! They went out to just make a better album, instead of doing something completely different (that'll come later). Their Debut must have been a giant success, because there's this big aura of confidence that every single member brings on here. Where LZ I feels like you're in a studio with them, LZ II feels like you're in a concert with them; the energy and tone here has completely been raised

27. Led Zeppelin - Led Zeppelin III (1970): A [3 listens] This was probably the hardest LZ album to put my finger on. I was at first taken aback by the more acoustic sound and moving slightly away from their signature heavy rock sound. With multiple listens, the individual songs grew on me more than any from their first two. It's a great album with a bunch of experimentation of the structure of their songs, but not straying too far from what I expect LZ to sound like (that'll come later). It feels like you're hanging out around a campfire in the middle of the wilderness. I'm glad they decided to go in a different direction on the 3rd album

28. The Stooges - Fun House (1970): A- [2 listens] A "vibe" album is the best way to describe this. Just pure emotion and energy, as if music just comes out of them. It's so messy at times, that it becomes an art in itself

29. Black Sabbath - Self-Titled (1970): A- [3 listens] I originally thought this was going to be more "thrash" when I saw that this was the first ever Heavy Metal album (that's what I assumed all heavy metal sounded like), so after the first listen I was pretty underwhelmed. Thankfully, I revisited this after I listened to Paranoid and it was a much better time. Something about this era with it's 6-10 minute songs, where they truly squeeze out every single ounce of creativity they have for each song. Where instead of the "best parts", every song feels like a separate entity; having it's own journey it goes through

30. Black Sabbath - Paranoid (1970): A+ [2 listens] holy shit, what a improvement. They took everything great from their Debut and just refined it. Sort of the opposite of their Debut; every song here is more concise and is straightforward in their directions. I also had to mention the best song transition I've heard with Planet Caravan into Iron Man

31. The Beatles - Let It Be (1970): B+ [3 listens] solid "epilogue", loved the stripped production to make it feel more unique, but it pails in comparison to what came before it

32. George Harrison - All Things Must Pass (1970): A [2 listens] The only triple album I've listened to I believe, it's doesn't overstay it's welcome. My Sweet Lord is still one of the greatest songs ever made, Apple Scruffs is a personal favorite, as well as Wah Wah. It feels like he's just rocking out and we're just along for the ride. I love the "wall of sound" production throughout, but it does lose some of it's glammer when it's overused. Fantastic project and I'm glad George finally got the praise he deserved

33. John Lennon - John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970): A [3 listens] Very personal album and not at all of what I expected a John Lennon solo project would be. With that said, it's an album that grows on you with every listen, as you get used to the tone. Although it's definitely a smaller scale project, with it's reduced production, his emotional vocal performance throughout really makes it's special

34. Led Zeppelin - Untitled "Led Zeppelin IV" (1971): A++ [4 listens] ingeniously building off of LZ III, this greatly adds on what it brought, while improving the production. The songs are no longer confined in a ordinary structure, free to go in any direction as they want and it perfectly highlights the incredible talent of the members, as their soloing to little moments of flair are on fully display. Stairway to Heaven (which I never heard before) and Levee Breaks are so great BECAUSE of this ability to completely change the song a quarter of the way through and then change it AGAIN! Only flaw is not every track is perfect (that'll come later). This one feels like I'm inside their minds, during a brainstorming process, watching them throw ideas at each other, bouncing off in complete harmony

35. The Who - Who's Next (1971): A+ [3 listens] Now I what their "best" looks like. Every song is fantastic, great songwriting throughout. The intro to Baba O'Riley is godly and that part in Won't Get Fooled Again was one of the most pleasant surprises so far. I'll definitely be listening to this more

36. Carole King - Tapestry (1971): A- [2 listens] Added it because of the lack of women I've seen, plus it's very highly rated. Pretty good but doesn't really feel like it's "rock". There's still a lot of enjoyable parts, she's a very expressive singer and is wonderful in making her songs feel personal

37. David Bowie - Hunky Dory (1971): A+ [2 listens] One of those people who I just accepted as "GOATs" without ever hearing their music, I was super excited to hear this. Really great, Bowie's performance is such a pleasure to listen to. I listened to this near the end and it's easier to see just how influential this sound would become in the upcoming decade

38. David Bowie - Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust (1972): A+ [2 listens] it's really a toss up between this and Hunky Dory on which I like better. Although, I like that this leans more into "rock" with it's heavier reliance on the guitar. Also, much better individual songs here

39. The Rolling Stones - Exile on Main Street (1972): B+ [1 listen] An improvement on Let It Bleed for me, it was much more enjoyable listen leaning more into a blues rock style that I believe is what they're best at, but I just don't think they're for me. That being said, it's hard to not like this album

40. Led Zeppelin - House of Holy (1973): A [3 listens] They sound like "veterans" here; the production, musicality, and composure with their individual instruments, are perfectly realized. They sound like one cohesive band, instead of 4 insanely talented guys just playing together (which isn't a negative, especially on LZ I and II). While I don't think they are at their best with the songwriting (that'll come later), it's easy to see that they're in their "prime"

41. Pink Floyd - The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) A [4 listens] "The Greatest Album of all time"? I've tried a few times to adore it but it didn't reach that level for me. What it is though, is the most cohesive album I've heard so far. It feels like 1 long song, which is a great compliment to describe the experience of listening to it (which I've come to see that it would become a trademark of Progressive Rock). Maybe if they added more "individual songs", I'd love it more. What all that being said, I can still see this being the GOAT in others eyes

42. Elton John - Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973): A++ [2 listens] him and Bowie were in the category of "Automatic Legends" that were just constants of the universe. So I was glad to see an Elton John album come up and this was marvelous! I definitely need more listens, but this can easily be masterpiece after 3 more listens. The pianos, the vocal performance, the guitars, organs? It's all perfect

43. Bruce Springsteen - Born to Run (1975) A [2 listens] Did not expect this to be that good. I thought he was closer to country, but it's delightfully more pop centric. Very energetic choruses and phenomenal saxophone playing (an instrument I play). The whole is very great and surprisingly fun

44. Aerosmith - Toys in the Attic (1975): B- [2 listens] I assumed this band was way bigger than I thought they were, so I'm surprised I didn't see more of their work highly rated. This is a solid collection of songs, but nothing too ear grabbing about it. I'll probably never touch this album again

45. The Eagles - Hotel California (1975): B [1 listen] a wonderful title song, but it's an okay album. The rest couldn't match up the Hotel California and it was all downhill from there. Still good music, but nothing great imo

46. Pink Floyd - Wish You Were Here (1975): A [2 listens] I saw some critic say the phrase "how do you follow up perfection? By making something that's arguably superior" and that's a pretty good description of this album. I actually like this one slightly more. The ethereal spaces in between the more meaty lyrical sections are much better and pronounced this time around. The instruments are much more interesting in those transitional sections. And the individual songs are also better as well, love this project

47. Led Zeppelin - Physical Graffiti (1975) A++ [2 listens] The whole thing is great, I'm done trying to wrap my head around them. I'm leaning towards this and IV being my favorite LZ albums. My final thoughts on LZ is that they are the only band where the lead singer isn't the dominate identity; the guitarist brings every song up 5 notches, the bass drives EVERY song perfectly, and the drummer... made me appreciate the incredibly fine line between being super creative and staying in the pocket for the band. Every album they get better and better, is it possible for them to make a subpar album? (That'll come later lol :p)

48. Queen - A Night at the Opera (1975): A- [2 listens] I had to add at least one Queen album and this is a fun, wonderfully crafted listen. Definitely one of those you listen to the full album, instead of individual songs. Only flaw is the major standouts are on the first and the last tracks, so it does make everything in between feel lesser. With that said, still a lovely album.

49. Patti Smith - Horses (1975): A- [3 listens] Where are all the women at lol? I saw this top a bunch of all time lists, but rarely any Rock only lists, so I really had to go out and find this one. Pretty good listen, feels like Punk, but with much more variety in it's styles. Awesome album, with a great opener as well. Her vocal style is awesome

50. Bob Dylan - Blood on the Tracks (1975): A++ [3 listens] A heartbroken, love stricten Dylan, who's really going through some stuff here. Still the great storytelling that made him a legend, but much much more focused than any of his albums before it, given it's central theme. Fantastic, fantastic album!

51. Boston - Self-Titled (1976): A [3 listens] What an opening. Short album, but it's all hits. Don't have much to say about it because of it's length, but it's the sound I most identify as "70s rock". The light, airy space of the vocals, with heavenly guitar chords and energetic, head nodding riffs

52. The Ramones - Self-Titled (1976): B [2 listens] The "original" sound of what would become punk rock, this was actually a pretty good listen. The guitar riffs to the stressed, nonchalant vocals surprisingly works. This isn't the most creativity fueled project, but for what it is, it's pretty enthralling; a group of guys rocking out

53. Sex Pistols - Never Mind the Bollocks, Here's the Sex Pistols (1977): B [2 listens] felt a bit repetitive at times with the vocal performance. With that being said, Johnny Rotten is the best part of this album, with the guitar and drums battling each other for 40 minutes being a close second. But definitely a good time

54. Fleetwood Mac - Rumours (1977): Masterpiece [4 listens] I've listened to this countless times (this amount is how much since I started the other albums). I absolutely love this album, from the harmonies, the musical rhythms, and the incredible quality from track to track. Not only is there not a single bad song here, but I'd go as far and say every song here is perfect

55. Steely Dan - Aja (1977): A [1 listen] I would call this more Jazz than Rock but that aside, this is a really fun listen. The Sax and the guitar steal nearly every song with their respective solos and every chorus is top notch.

56. Bruce Springsteen - Darkness on the Edge of Town (1978): A [2 listens] 2nd Springsteen album, this one is more varied in it's sound and no dragging moments at all. Actually, there's more impactful sections throughout, louder and closer to rock here, leaning on the drums and guitar much more.

57. Van Halen - Self-Titled (1978): B- [1 listen] This is a name I heard of before and after listening to this, it's definitely a sound I'm familiar with. This screams 80s guitar riffs to me and it was pretty fun to hear. The songwriting isn't really worth listening, but it's a great peek into what would be the mainstay sound for the upcoming decade.

58. The Clash - London Calling (1979): Masterpiece [5 listens] this is a great example of the difference between having a style and having an identity. My problem with other "punk" albums is that they all felt repetitive from song to song but with this, the styles constantly change and switch to keep it fresh from track to track; without losing their unique brand of sound. The guitar isn't unwieldy force, but is controlled and steady and can be that energetic force when it needs to (and you can actually hear the bass guitar!). The vocals lead every song and they are AMAZING, near the top of my favorite. It's punk rock at it's best

59. Joy Division - Unknown Pleasures (1979): A- [2 listens] Sounds like Gothic rock, but with punk influence. Love Day of the Lords and everything else is pretty solid. Great voice for this style, I'll listen to Closer in the future

60. AC/DC - Highway to Hell (1979): B+ [2 listens] With Back In Black being my very first intro into rock a long time ago, I was surprised that ACDC actually had a different lead singer at first. So this was definitely one I was interested in hearing the "original" (I, of course heard the title song before, but it didn't connect that it was different people). And while he and the band was great, to me it's always in Black In Black's shadow. Really fun album

61. AC/DC - Back In Black (1980): A++ [6 listens] The first rock album I listened to years before starting this list, it positively represented how "good" rock music was for me and that it's not so foreign as I always assumed it was. Listening to it in comparison with other albums, it's sound isn't as varied (the stereotypical flaw I attributed to ALL rock), but it's extremely consistent from track to track. My opinion of it didn't really change as much, but it will always the "first", so I have more love for it than others. Also, THIS guitarist is my favorite... by a mile

62. Motörhead - Ace of Spades (1980): B [ 2 listens] If you heard one song, you pretty much heard all their stuff. Luckily, their sound is pretty fun. I thought this was going to be Thrash Metal in sound, but it's much more of Hard Rock

63. Talking Heads - Remain In Light (1980): Masterpiece [3 listens] I saw it pretty high on RS top 500 list and the strikingly, creepy album cover quickly grabbed my attention. The cover art does a great job at setting the expectations, this is weird, odd, exciting, and captivating. The multiple layers of the background vocals, awesome guitar riffs, the lead in his weird, off-putting delivery in particular songs makes it insanely intriguing. But it's the percussion that truly makes this a masterpiece; it feels like there's 3 to 5 people playing different types of drums at a single time. This album is exhilarating and is an absolute banger. It feels like I'm having a fever dream; I don't even care if this is considered rock or not, it's great

64. Iron Maiden - Number of the Beast (1982) B [3 listens] I assumed it would thrash and ended up hating it. After more listens, its not half bad. The lead singer pretty much steals the show. Don't enter albums with preconceived sounds to expect, because you might get disappointed when it's different

65. Def Leppard - Pyromania (1983): B [2 listens] I had to do some background on the band and saw they were "Glam Rock" for context. So after having better framing, it's not half bad. Too Late for Love is a great song and they keep their style consistent for the most part. I'm still not the biggest fan of this genre, but I can at least respect it, which is kinda the whole point of this

66. R.E.M. - Murmur (1983): A [2 listens] never heard of this band before, but saw that they were influential in Alt Rock so I added this to the list. Very nice and laid back album. Not hard rock like most 80s albums, but enough energy throughout where I didn't get bored. I have a feeling this might grow on me more and more, really loved it on the 2nd listen

67. Bruce Springsteen - Born in the USA (1984): A+ [2 listens] On the 2nd listen, this one is my favorite from him. Same quality of music, but much better individual songs on this one, especially on Side B. I thought I was gonna hate his music going in and now, songs like Glory Days and Cover Me are in my standard rotation

68. Dire Straits - Brothers in Arms (1985): B [1 listen] pretty solid, nothing to incredible to say about it. More of a synth-pop and relaxed sound than a hard rock, but it's still good for what it is.

69. Metallica - Master of Puppets (1986): Masterpiece [4 listens] This is the "Black Album", but permanently stuck at 10. It was a bit relentless for me after the first listen, but since then, it's energy is matched by only a few albums. The guitarist is just having the time of his life, the base guitarist just ignores him and goes 120 mph for 40 minutes, while the drummer is seizuring, with random pausing and banging the hell out of the drumheads. Meanwhile, the lead masterfully finds a way to sing over this chaos. Even with all of this anarchy, there is clear structure underneath the madness, that makes the multiple listens more and more rewarding. I fully understand why it's called "Thrash" metal

70. Bon Jovi - Slippery When Wet (1986): B+ [1 listen] I'm pretty familiar with all the singles, but I was still surprised how good the whole thing was. I can listen to "Glam Rock", but it's not particularly my favorite. With that said, there's so many songs here that are heart pumping bangers, that I can't help but love

71. U2 - Joshua Tree (1987): B+ [2 listens] I'm definitely familiar with U2 and heard about them being very conceited and stuff like that. But as always, I go into every album with an open mind and this was pretty solid. Not really the Rock album I was expecting, but when I understood their style, it was hard to not be impressed with what they're doing here. Not my favorite type of music, but it's a solid project with no skippable sections anywhere

72. Guns & Roses - Appetite for Destruction (1987): A- [2 listens] one of the early albums I listened to and it blew me away! I loved the Hard Rock style and the peaks of high and low energy songs are connected by the incredible guitar playing; the singer is great, but the guitarist carries this album for me. Revisiting it, it doesn't have that same impact as it did the first time but it's still so much fun

73. The Cure - Disintegration (1989): A [2 listens] I thought it was gonna be more heavy metal based on the cover art and I HATED it on the first listen. After time away and better expectations of what it expect, this is so damn amazing; literally a 180° in my opinion. The moody, brooding tone is too great to not like and by far the best intro into an album

74. Pixies - Doolittle (1989): A- [2 listens] Never heard of them, but saw they were some of the influences of Nirvana. And I can definitely hear it, the vocal style here is very similar. I really can't put my finger on the musical genre, it's more of a mix of things instead of deviatives of genres, which is really interesting. Going to visit their other stuff later

75. Metallica - Self-Titled "The Black Album" (1991): A [3 listens] The first "metal" album I heard and its fucking incredible. Instantly knew that this was going to be my favorite genre of Rock. The vocals, guitar, the bass, the DRUMMING!!!! What a great intro to metal and I loved it. After hearing more albums, it doesn't quite hold up to others with it's weaker second half, but I played the first half of this more than any album in my car on Max volume. Still a personal favorite

76. Nirvana - Nevermind (1991): Masterpiece [6 listens] this has always been the standard from what I expect from the great rock albums. LOVED it the first time I heard it and still love it now. The first half of this album is perfection and the second half matches it with some great songs. It somehow tows the line of being super exciting and aggressive, yet very laid back and chill (I guess that's what "grunge rock" is). It's great, and I love it when more compared to the other albums I've now know. Perfection

77. U2 - Achtung Baby (1991): A- [3 listens] this is exactly the direction I wanted them to go in after Joshua's Tree. More upbeat and leaning more into Pop at times, it's much more captivating this time around. The songwriting is also much better here. I wouldn't have guessed that I would love a U2 album

78. Pearl Jam - Ten (1991): Masterpiece [5 listens] No clue who these guys were, but I saw someone suggest this as one of the greatest debut albums ever and next to Nevermind, it was one of the biggest pushers for grunge rock, so I listened to it early. Holy hell, what an intro to grunge! This moody yet passionate vocal performance mixed with this hard rock sound, goes together like peanut butter and jelly. One of the best first listens I had as well, I was just so surprised how great it was and how in the hell that I never heard of these guys before

79. Red Hot Chili Peppers - Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991): A+ [2 listens] I have heard of this band and I always had the connotation that they were corny/played out, for some reason (main reason it was near the last to be on the list). Man, is this album funky! Love the sound and they go all in on it as well. I have no idea how this was so successful during the grunge rock wave, but I'm glad it was

80. Rage Against The Machine - Self-Titled (1992): A++ [4 listens] Thank God I listened to this near the end, because this would've set the bar way to high for anything to follow. THIS should always be on the top of the list for any Rock album to suggest to rap fans. The perfect combination of hard/heavy metal and aggressive vocals and drumming. Excellent project

81. Alice in Chains - Dirt (1992): A [2 listens] I can't remember why, but I hated it on the first listen for some reason. But he second listen was so damn enjoyable, a complete opposite experience. The harmonies shouldn't work with this grunge metal sound, but it somehow goes together beautifully. It's a shame that I felt that I "hated" it for so long

82. Nirvana - In Utero (1993): A [2 listens] Held off on this, as to not get overly familiar with Nirvana as "the" sound of grunge rock. This feels more dirtier and more grittier with it's production. They do something different and I respect it so much for not taking the easy road

83. The Smashing Pumpkins - Siamese Dream (1993): A+ [2 listens] I was going to skip this one, because I felt I already listened to enough Grunge Rock albums. Thank God I didn't, because this shows just the amount of versatility this genre lends itself to. They can go from slow to energetic, pulled back to emotional, rough and heavy to harmonic and beautiful. If this was shorter, I'd probably have listened to it more and raised the rating, but this is still really special

84. Nine Inch Nails - Downward Spiral (1994): A [3 listens] The best way to describe it is "controlled chaos". As if he's inside a tornado; picking up random, mangled debris flying around and creating music with it. This is unabashedly raw, gritty, and openly unrelenting. I really don't know WHY it works, but wow, it works amazingly. What a great experience

85. Green Day - Dookie (1994): A [2 listens] I've heard of American Idiot, so I was interested to see what made them known. This was really enjoyable and is similar to what my idea of what "punk" sounded like. Very difficult to point out any weak spots anywhere as the entire thing is extremely consistent. Just by looking at the cover and hearing the first few seconds of the first song, I can instantly visualize the mood of some random teen in the mid 90s in their bedroom

86. Soundgarden - Superunknown (1994): A [2 listens] Never heard of this band before and I vaguely know the name Chris Cornell, so I added to the list. Man, is this an awesome time. Whereas Nirvana tilts a bit more towards Hard Rock than punk imo, this feels like it firmly defines what grunge is to me. There's great songs spread throughout the whole album, so the runtime feels much easier (a criticism I have with longer albums; not spreading out the good songs). I feel like there's still room to grow with this album, but it's possible to become a masterpiece

87. Weezer - Self-Titled "The Blue Album" (1994): A- [1 listen] this is the punk rock of Dookie, but without the teenage angst and rage in the music (there's still a bit in the lyrics). This seemed like the album for the "average" 90s teen and feels like the actual soundtrack to an entire generation. Where Dookie was that stereotypical "90s awesome teen", this was something more realistic and more grounded

88. Oasis - Definitely Maybe (1994): A [2 listen] this was described as a "breath of fresh air in the era of Grunge Rock dominance", which is a cool perspective on why this is so well received. This "Britpop" album is much more fun and honestly, lighter than the stuff in the same year. Quite a few standout songs and it keeps that bright ray of sunlight throughout it's runtime

89. Radiohead - The Bends (1995): B+ [1 listen] I chose to set a full day aside for all of Radiohead's albums, because Ok Computer was the main reason I started this whole thing, so I went ahead and listened to all of their best albums together. In hindsight, a peek to what's to come, but compared to everything else, it's slightly above average. Still entertaining for what it is

90. Radiohead - Ok Computer (1997) A++ [3 listens] the most anticipated album on my list, due to the fact I saw a Reddit post about this being one of the most influential albums of the 2000s and I never heard of it not even once in my life. This is a really interesting album. Its more of a full experience than a collection of songs, but here the songs build off one another. Deeper into the album, every song here better and better. This isn't my favorite style/genre of music, but it's still so damn good

91. Radiohead - Kid A (2000): Masterpiece [4 listens] Ok, THIS is how you follow up perfection. They really lean into the weird side of Ok Computer without completely leaving the pocket of what they're great at. Experimental is the best word to describe this. The first song slaps you in the face of what type of journey you're going on and it doesn't let go of your hand until it finishes. It's atmospheric tone is unmatched at times, even when it sacrifices the more "meaty" individual songs like on Ok Computer or later on In Rainbows. But it's like entering another dimension for 45 minutes. Also, Idioteque gives me goosebumps even after the 10th listen

92. System of a Down - Toxicity (2001): Masterpiece [4 listens] I remember the name of this band growing up and I was surprised none of their projects came up when I searched for albums to add to my list. So I added their most liked album, and it was the best decision I made. This album is so fucking incredible. I love it for it's insane energy, but I've come up adore it for it's beauty in it's harmonic choruses and awesome baselines. My favorite performance by a singer on a project, more for his uniqueness in his inflection and the passion behind every phrase, he's giving 1000% on every song

93. The Strokes - Is This It (2001): A+ [2 listens] I thought it was going to be more heavy metal (the cover art with the woman). On the second listen, the choruses here are just way too good to hate. Super chill songs, but again, it's the passionated vocal performance that make it great. This is far from a "boring album" I once thought it was. The "fractals" cover is a better fit

94. The White Stripes - Elephant (2003): A+ [3 listens] Banger! SNA is still one of the greatest riffs ever, but it thankfully didn't overshadow the rest of the project. It's still mind-boggling that there's no bass guitar on this. The variety was unexpected, but really legitimatizes the entire album as a whole and not just the best songs

95. Arcade Fire - Funeral (2004): A- [2 listens] a really consistent listen from track to track. This is a sound I'm somewhat familiar with hearing growing up, but never associated it with "rock". This style won't wow you, but it's the style that make it such a beautiful album

96. Green Day - American Idiot (2004): A+ [1 listen] This time around, the sound is much more refined and there's a grander theme here; making this feel like a giant leap in their writing. Fantastic title track and I also had no idea Blvd of Broken Dreams was a Green Day song, so that was a great surprise. I'll listen to it more to better catch the story between the lyrics

97. Arctic Monkeys - Whatever You Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006): A++ [1 listen] Wow, what a sound! It's that indie rock style, but leaning into a punk style as well. Every song on here just places you into a mood and it's awesome! Also, love that it has a consistent theme of clubbing throughout the whole album. I'll listen to it more, but man this is great

98. Radiohead - In Rainbows (2007): A++ [3 listens] They take a different different direction here, putting more emphasis on individual songs having their own distinct identity. All 3 are neck and neck, with Kid A being the favorite

99. LCD Soundsystem - Sound of Silver (2007): A- [1 listen] This sounds more Electronic than Rock for most of it, but it's still a great listen. I recognize that one song from a 2k soundtrack  


100. Tame Impala - Currents (2015): A- [1 listen] The newest album I've listen to, but turns the clock back with a psychedelic rock sound. Really really nice feel, a mix of psyche and disco. Not as hard hitting as I like, but still consistent in what it wants to deliver

Just to comment on The Band naming themselves that and being presumptuous. They were actually Bob Dylan’s backing band when he first went electric. Everyone always referred to them as ‘the band’ so that’s the name they took. One of the band members talks about it in The Last Waltz movie.

You mentioned RATM’s debut being a great rock intro album for rap fans, funnily enough it was my intro to rap as a rock fan.

I love your enthusiasm and willingness just to dive in. I generally hold the same opinions as you about Aerosmith, but I can’t bring myself to enjoy a lot of hair bands (Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, etc…) but I’m glad you got something from them

**Memory transcription subject:** ***Captain Sovlin, Federation Fleet Command***

*Date \[standardized human time\]: October 18, 2136*

The UN fleet deposited me in a cell on Venlil Prime, and without warning, the predators stopped visiting me altogether. Based on the claw tallies on the wall, I calculated that it had been at least a week. The Venlil guards were colder than the humans. One of them spit in my evening gruel, and muttered a curse against my ‘depraved soul.’ Against all odds, I found myself missing Carlos and even Samantha.

I kept busy by contemplating the Arxur’s interrogation, and how to refute their absurd story. There had to be reconciliation between the Terrans and the Federation. It had required an unthinkable cost, but the Gojid government was swayed to the humans’ corner. Unfortunately, Prime Minister Piri’s death was confirmed by UN ground forces; her final transmission could only achieve so much.

“I offered to bargain with the Federation for them, but then, the humans abandoned me. They’re just gone,” I mused aloud.

If I strained on my hindlegs, I could peer between out the window to the capital below. Venlil Prime was a massive planet that dwarfed the likes of Earth and the cradle. By comparison, it had a shorter orbit and slightly higher gravity than the average world. 

Interestingly, much of its land-mass was inhospitable. Sunlight never touched half of its surface, leaving it too cold for plant and animal life. Its bright side had the opposite problem, too scorching hot to sustain water sources. There was only the thin space between extremes to build settlements. 

Venlil scientists searched for new ways to push the frontiers, with various methods to cool their planet. They manipulated atmospheric reflectivity with aerosols, built an artificial upwelling system in their ocean, and used cloud seeding to generate rainfall. It took colossal effort to keep the gears in motion.

*Not all species are blessed with a perfect home. If it weren’t for sentiment, Venlil colonies are much more conducive to habitation.*

The sight of human predators walking about became more frequent, over the past few days. Many Venlil would give them a wide berth, or cross to the other side of the street. I wondered why Earth was suddenly sending so many people abroad. Such a widespread presence was a lot to ask of their friends. 

A pointed cough came from the other side of the cell door. “Enjoying the view? Looks like you’ve had *plenty* of time to study the intricacies of Venlil society.”

I whirled around to see Samantha, with her auburn hair tied back in a knot. Her predatory eyes were unfocused, as though her mind was elsewhere. The anger in her voice bore a colder aspect than last time I saw her. My instincts pronounced her demeanor as highly threatening.

Was there something I had done to infuriate the humans? Or worse, were they becoming corrupted by the Arxur?

“H-hello, Sam. I thought you guys had forgotten about me,” I answered.

She bared her pearly fangs, eyes dilating in a flash. “My friends call me Sam. You’re not my friend.”

“Right. Sorry.”

“That you should be.”

Bootsteps sounded behind Samantha, and I breathed a sigh of relief as I recognized Carlos. For a moment, I thought the female had snuck in alone to assault me. Everything about her stance screamed that she was thirsty for blood. Maybe it was simply not seeing a human in days, but I felt there was some substance to my inference.

There was a jingling sound as the male guard slid keys into the door. The spark was gone from his brown eyes, and his subdued mannerisms were uncharacteristic. The last time I saw Carlos, he was ribbing me and striking down my thoughts at every turn. There was no sign of playful mockery or admonishment now.

My spines bristled in alarm. “What happened to you both? Something is wrong.”

Carlos gave me a weary frown. “Earth was attacked by the Federation. Over a billion dead.”

“Don’t pretend like you care. You got what you wanted, Sovlin,” Samantha growled.

Horror washed over me, and I sank back onto my bed. No wonder the humans were upset. I remembered what it felt like to watch the cradle burn, to grapple with the loss of my home and culture. Why did the Federation have to piss off the only species to defeat the Arxur?

There was a time where I wanted to cripple the ‘predators’ breeding grounds’; that derogative terminology still rang in my ears. When I turned myself in to UN custody, I was expecting to witness a brutal society. Instead, Earth amounted to decent people going about their daily existences. It was a structured planet, rich in life and culture.

“That’s not what I want now.” I nibbled at my claws with anxiety, and tried to keep my expression submissive. “I’m sorry for your loss. I…know what it’s like to be in your paws.”

Samantha clenched her fists. “Of course you do. You caused your world’s death, while trying to kill us. Just like the Krakotl.”

“You’re right. We brought it on ourselves, and I know that. We were horrible to humans, more so than any apology could ever excuse. Yet you showed mercy and compassion.”

“Fuck mercy. The rest of our fleet went home. But we get tethered to you, while Earth is under siege. How is that fair?”

“It’s not, but I have no say in that. I can see you’re hurting. Er, if it makes you feel better to quarrel with me, then I…encourage you to do so.”

Samantha turned her back in disgust. There was no way for me to offer amends that would satisfy her. All the same, my concern for her mental health was escalating. I knew how grief could swallow a person without a proper outlet.

I cast an inquisitive stare toward Carlos, looking for direction. The male guard’s nostrils flared with pent-up frustration. Had the humans only visited to extol their anger on me?

“I’m glad you’re both okay,” I added, breaking the icy silence. “I hope some of Earth was able to hold out.”

Carlos nodded. “We drove them off…with help.”

“Help? From the Venlil?”

“Sure. And other interested parties.”

*That is a vague descriptor. Who else would’ve come to rescue humanity?*

Carlos waved for me to follow him, and the absence of his snarl was striking. It was like the guards had received a personality transplant. Both seemed infused with hatred and impassivity, though one was directing it at me more than the other. I was frightened of what their predatory emotions could compel them to do.

Dark thoughts raced through my mind, as I tried to recall why I trusted these predators. Their heroism on the cattle ship seemed a distant memory. My eyes widened in alarm, at consideration of the rescued. That reminded me of the Gojids on Earth, cared for outside a large metropolis.

“What happened to the Gojid refugees?” I blurted. “I’m sorry if that’s selfish, but I have to know…”

The male guard sighed. “The primary camp was brought to Venlil Prime, when we started moving human evacuees. Most are safe.”

“That is…positive news. How many humans did you evacuate from Earth?”

“Millions. We’ve known the Venlil all of three months. Some people preferred to ride it out in a bunker, or were banking on us to rout their forces.”

“Stop talking to that racist, delusional prick like he’s your pal!” Samantha spat. “Carlos, I thought we had this conversation.”

The olive-skinned human crossed his arms. “I’m being civil. There’s a difference.”

Not wanting to sow more division between the duo, I kept my other questions to myself. That did explain why the human presence had increased rapidly. The cynical part of me wondered if the predator influx resulted in a spike in crime. The primates posed an extraordinary threat when they were angry…and they had to be more prone to deviant behavior than Venlil.

Carlos led the way past native wardens, and we stepped out into the capital’s crisp air. The guards’ strides seemed a bit strained from gravitational exertion. The difference on Venlil Prime wasn’t enough to be significant, but the humans would tire quicker in physical activities. It was another reminder that they weren't home.

A pair of Gojids were waiting by a spacecraft outside, joined by several UN personnel. My eyes widened as I realized why they were familiar. It was the deaf youth, Talpin, and his sister, Berna. Both seemed to be in better spirits than the last time I saw them, and were carrying necessities.

*I can’t believe I thought the humans were going to kill the kid, first time I saw him. We all shared that thought.*

“Hello, Captain Sovlin.” A synthesized voice spoke the words in the Gojid tongue, but with a bit of human growl. Talpin must have been given an AI program with Terran phonemes installed. “Why are you being kept in a prison? You are a hero to us all.”

The young Gojid finished sliding his claws across a keyboard, and fixed me with an expectant look. I didn’t want to recount my crimes in detail; then again, I wasn’t sure how to begin translating my reply. At least Samantha seemed mollified by Talpin’s presence. Perhaps it served as a reminder of her deaf brother.

“I deserve to be there. I made another person…a human, suffer,” I muttered.

Talpin turned his pupils to a nearby human, and scanned the contortions of their fingers. His eyes widened. The adolescent struggled to believe that I could be involved with anything nefarious. His beige claws hovered over the keyboard for a moment, before he typed out a reply.

“Why?” came the synthesized question. “Your deeds are spoken of in legend. You are a hero, a righteous man. You save lives.”

I lowered my gaze. “I’m none of those things. I thought causing a predator pain would fix my problems.”

Berna appeared stunned as well. “You sound like you’re talking about torture, Sovlin. That’s…vile. The humans are sweet, sensitive…generous.”

I blinked in agreement, lowering my gaze. The predators beside Talpin projected fondness toward him, but I could see their jaws tightening as they listened to me. At least if Berna spread the word about Marcel, my people would squash the myth of my heroism. I deserved to have my legacy tarnished, and to be remembered for the sum of my crimes.

Talpin tapped at his keyboard. “How could the humans treat you so kindly?”

“I don’t know. Ask them,” I answered.

The UN volunteer beside him thought for a moment, before launching into an emphatic reply. The human translator seemed passionate about whatever she was conveying. The deaf Gojid looked impressed at what was passed on, and nodded in acceptance. He shot me a disdainful look.

I cast a nervous glance at Samantha. “You speak ‘sign language.’ What did she tell him?”

The guard flashed her teeth. “That you deserve to live with what you’ve done. That human discipline doesn’t stoop to your level.”

Well, that was a recurring sentiment when predators spoke of me. What I didn’t understand was why the guards brought me to meet Talpin and Berna. It looked like the two Gojids were about to depart on a spaceship. After my disclosure, I doubted they’d want a send-off from me.

“I don’t want to travel anywhere with him.” Talpin waved his claws emphatically at the predators. “Not if he tortured a human. He is a disgrace to our kind.”

Berna curled her lip. “I second the notion. We both owe humanity our lives.”

My confusion intensified, and I shot Carlos a questioning look. Talpin seemed to think I was accompanying them on a trip, but I didn’t have an inkling what he was referring to. Where were the humans taking them? Was I actually involved?

“Sovlin is the perfect person to pass on several messages for us. He can get you two through the door with those Kolshian bastards.” The male guard tossed his shoulders in a noncommittal gesture. “He’s also the one some Federation fuckwits might believe about the Gojid refugees and the war.”

That was a good omen if the humans still wanted peace and dialogue. Maybe the attack on Earth hadn’t completely pushed them to the Arxur side, as improbable as that seemed. These Terran predators had a merciful side, and I hoped we could appeal to that.

It didn’t sound like the entirety of the Federation was involved; the neutrals had minded their own business. There had to be some people that could convert to Terran advocacy. Other races didn’t have to end up like the Gojids.

Warmth filled my chest. “A messenger? I’d be happy to testify on your behalf, and broker peace with your enemies. I know about remediation—”

Samantha scowled. “Peace is not an option anymore. Frankly, I’d declare war on all of the skeptics now, but we can’t fight 300 species at once. At least, not yet. We’re going to purge the 24 who attacked us, followed by the 14 others who voted for war.”

“W-what? That’s the message?” I gasped.

Carlos shook his head. “No; I’ll get to that in a minute. Firstly, we need someone who can look into several items for us.”

“Read this. We had it printed in your tongue, extra special for you,” the female guard sneered.

My shaking claws accepted the pamphlet, terrified at what the predators had inscribed. The paper nearly slipped from my grasp at once; mournful tears pooled in my eyes. Recel was dead…killed by his own government for siding with humanity.

I had mentored the Kolshian since he was a child, and shepherded his development. His advice on the bridge, combined with his honor, was steadfast. I wanted him commanding my ship in my absence. It pained me that our last interactions were him viewing me as a monster.

My vision burned, and I dabbed at the wetness with my fur. The humans wanted to uncover why the Kolshians would resort to murder. It was unclear whether any future violence was planned against pro-human factions, but the predators weren't taking threats lightly. Not after Earth.

*The Terrans don’t want species reaching out with false friendship. They want anyone who plots against them exposed. Humiliated.*

Why would the scholarly Commonwealth be so opposed to humanity's diplomatic outreach? I was itching to demand Chief Nikonus’ reasons for myself. He came across as a fair leader, reasonable to a fault. I would’ve considered him the kind who would give predators a fair shake. 

“Look into the Kolshian matter for us, and find documentation of first contact with the Arxur. See what you can dig up,” Carlos growled.

Samantha crossed her arms. “We need to know who’s complicit in every scheme against us and our allies. Who is worth sparing…who started this predator hatred and why.”

The male guard narrowed his eyes. “Our governments believe that you feel remorse, that you’re not a flight risk. This is what we need from you, Sovlin.”

“Okay. And the message?” I stammered. “You implied there was a statement to deliver.”

“Oh, that’s easy. Tell the Federation we’re done contacting or negotiating with them. They never raised a finger to stop the attack on Earth. Let the neutrals know that they either reach out to condemn this terrorist act, or they can prepare for total war.”

That message sent a chill through my blood; the other Gojids looked horrified as well. I needed to find a more tactful way of phrasing that flagrant threat, if there was to be peace with any species. The humans could rack up a lot of collateral damage, in seeking revenge for their Earth.

Part 52 has arrived! We learn the much-requested whereabouts of Sovlin and the Gojids, and also catch a glimpse of humanity’s policy shift toward the Feds. Samantha does not have authority to speak for the UN, but she makes it evident that some of us are bloodthirsty. Who deserves to be lumped in with the Krakotl? How do you think the Federation neutrals will respond to the message?

Also, I added some new Venlil Prime lore for those of you curious on that. Their atmospheric manipulation *might* be helpful undoing damage to Earth. As for the human refugees, the ordinary Venlil citizens aren’t accustomed to us walking around, with a presence in the millions. Do you think we can ‘fit in’ to their society?

As always, thank you for reading! I’m planning to release 53 on Monday; we’ll see the UN perspective, the Arxur fallout, and a more detailed damage report.

To put things into perspective. The one species wanting peace had been attacked and had a billion killed, the survivors want blood, and the Federation has been weakened.

Humanity is now in a position to side with the Arxur.

I doubt the federation is coming out of this at all. It would be a miracle at this rate.

Hey everyone,


A couple of weeks ago, I did a (too?) many-word retrospective [[Part I](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48058), [Part II](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48064), [Part III](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48072)] on the last six months or so of *Destiny 2*. This covered what we think worked well, what didn’t work as well as we’d hoped, and some of our thinking on where *Destiny 2* is heading. You’ll see some of this manifesting in what’s coming this fall:


* A *Rise of Iron*–sized expansion, *Shadowkeep*, where we’ll explore how the Moon has evolved since we were there last. (See how vague I’m being? It’s because I don’t want to SPOIL. There are many, many sleeps to go.)
* Overhauls to key game systems such as armor that give you more choices on how you play and look.
* Evolution of game difficulty systems, starting with changes to Nightfall strikes. (You may have seen a preview last week at gamescom; more on that down the road.)
* Features that make it easier to play with friends, such as *New Light** (more below) and Cross Save. (I see all of you new-to-PC players. Thanks to the PC community for welcoming them!)


We’re simultaneously deepening the parts of *Destiny 2* we know and love, but also removing the prohibitive stuff from before that made *Destiny 2* hard to play with your friends.


This is a real high-wire act. We want *Destiny* to be a game where every blueberry *could* become someone who calls the Tower home.


My hands have had a week off from typing, so let’s talk about seasonal philosophy and how Seasons are shifting to fit with how we tell stories and move the world forward in the vision of *Destiny 2* as a single, evolving world.


I mentioned in the [Director’s Cut, Part III](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48072) that we want Destiny to be a world that has narrative momentum, and a key part of that will be how Seasons support Year 3. Back in June, we mentioned that one of the ways we’re making it easier for friends to play together is to offer everything à la carte. We’re going to do just that with each Season. You and your friends can choose what you want to play, and the world will change every Season.


Year 3 will have four fully supported Seasons of content (last year’s Annual Pass had only three!), but this year, you can opt in to each Season for 10 bucks—you won’t have to pay up front for an entire year of content, like with the *Forsaken* Annual Pass. (FYI, the first season in this new vision, Season of the Undying, is included with *Shadowkeep*, but if you just want to experience Season of the Undying, you can grab that à la carte without needing *Shadowkeep*.)

##The World of Destiny 2 Changes Every Season

With each new Season in *Destiny*, we want players to feel like they—as a community—are contributing to *Destiny’s* evolving world. Each Season in *Destiny* has to ride the line between delivering self-contained, Season-long world arcs and making the handoff to the next season. Together, Seasons move the *Destiny* universe forward.


In Season of the Undying, the portal to the Black Garden that was opened as a part of JacketQuest has awoken the Vex, and they are now pouring out across the surface of the Moon. Working with Ikora, players will [Do Some Stuff, Go Somewhere, Fight Some Things, and Solve a Problem aka REDACTED]. By the end of the Season, the portals will close, the world state will change, and the Seasonal activity connected to it will go away.


Yet *something* remains. This will be just in time for [REDACTED] to kick off the start of Season Nine—Season of Dawn.


Everyone who plays *Destiny* will be able to see how the world is different and changing during the Season. Those with the Season Pass will be able to play a seasonal matchmade activity within the Black Garden for that extra level of sweet gear (this is similar to the old Annual Pass access), but the goal is that everyone will be involved in how the world changes.


And at the end of the Season, your collective actions will have caused the world state to change and the Seasonal Activity connected to those events will also go away.


Doing this allows us to evolve the world—narratively, but potentially physically as well. It is not possible to keep *Destiny* frozen in place to allow all activities to live forever while also changing the world in meaningful ways. This strategy lets our team be agile and innovative. We believe that *Destiny* will grow even better when the world state can change, and that the best *Destiny* stories are the ones where “you had to be there when….”


But while events and activities in the world will come and go as the world evolves, *weapons critical to the meta* will not be locked in each Season for new players or for players who missed that Season. Legendaries and Exotics you need to stay competitive will be re-earnable in the future, although not always immediately after the Season ends. We’ll be talking more about that later—this is one area where, with the new seasonal model, we expect our plans to evolve across the Seasons to meet the needs of the *Destiny* community.


And while we’re on the subject of gear and weapons, I want to talk about some other additions we’re making to your chase to create whatever-your-perfect-Guardian-is.


**Reward Philosophy in D2Y3**

As we dug into how to deepen the customization of your Guardians, we wanted a reward system that could: standardize some of the reward mechanisms each Season, provide clear value in its rewards, make the value of a paid Season super clear, and allow players predictable progression via XP.


We all love the chase—that perfect roll!—but we all play differently. Year 3 will add more transparency and predictability while still giving you the RNG option for the unexpected gear or roll you didn’t know you loved until you got it.


We’re adding two new predictable reward pursuits in Season of the Undying.


**Seasonal Artifact**

Our first addition is the new Seasonal Artifact, which is free to all players. This will allow you to further customize your Guardian’s build every Season by unlocking additional mods to socket in your Armor 2.0 [link to post] gear. Earning XP just by playing will level up your Artifact, letting you unlock the next mod you want for your characters.


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126826/undying_artifact_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/eaJ7G0N.jpg)


While leveling up and unlocking mods, you will also increase the Power of the Artifact, which will continue increasing until the end of the Season (yes, it is uncapped). Artifact Power adds directly to your overall Power and is *account-wide*. We are both excited, and a little terrified, to see how high players will manage to raise their Artifact Power during the Season.


We want the Artifact to let us experiment more freely with our sandbox. During the last five years of *Destiny*, we’ve really wrestled with (and continue to wrestle with) obsolescence and permanence in player Power. So, when we were coming up with something new in the Seasonal Artifact, we wanted to figure out how we could have a system that allowed players to create build-altering powers yet not need to commit indefinitely to whatever they made and have it live on forever.


We want to date new builds, not get them hitched into the forever combat ecosystem.


It doesn’t have to be forever anymore. The Artifact can spotlight some different ways to play each Season and introduce new types of perks, while we (and you!) can experiment more boldly with new combinations and expressions of Power. We want to use the Artifact as a mechanic to allow the game to shift some each Season. In an action game like *Destiny*, part of the fun can be discovering new ways to play.


Here’s an example from my own play: I earned Wendigo this season. I did it naturally, by grinding a ton of strikes (although I was pretty tempted to go farm Blind Well with a group to make it go faster). I ended up using Fighting Lion a bunch in these strikes to get my grenade kills (omg why don’t the guys at the end of “The Hollowed Lair” count?!). What I found was that I really liked using Grenade Launchers, but I hadn’t really given them a spot in my routine PvE loadout (I don’t have Mountaintop). But as I was playing with Fighting Lion, I was getting better at using breech-loaded Grenade Launchers and at timing my detonations, et cetera.


So, while I was on WendigoQuest, I ended up developing an appreciation for an archetype I’d largely overlooked, and I developed some new skills (OK, “skills”) while earning Wendigo.


Seasonal Artifacts and Seasonal mods will go away at the end of each Season. And the new Season will bring a new Artifact, new mods, and a new pursuit for Power. This way, we can try bolder balance choices each Season with the sandbox, and if we get it a little wrong, we’ll be more likely to let it ride for the whole Season without nerfing your new favorite OP build.


**Seasonal XP Progression**

The second predictable reward chase we’re adding to Seasons are Season Pass Ranks. Some of you might have spotted this on the August 14 armor stream, but we didn’t provide any context. Without context, it’s really easy to find yourself on the jumping-to-conclusions mat. (This is totally human; we all do it. I certainly do. It’s OK.)


Let’s talk about these ranks.


We want to make sure that each Season has multiple, complementary reward sources, because we all play *Destiny* differently, and we want to be able to customize our Guardians the way we want to. We will continue to have RNG rewards as a part of our activities, and we also want to add a direct track of rewards each Season that you can progress every evening. The best weapons and armor will still live in the treasure chests of our toughest monsters and villains, but we hope now there will be fewer nights where players feel like they logged into *Destiny* and got nothing done.


The Internet is talking a lot about different builds in games. Season Ranks are kind of like a build for playing a season of *Destiny*. Grabbing bounties, doing strikes, completing weekly challenges—these are straightforward ways to unlock Season Pass Ranks when you don’t have the time to arrange a raid group, or check Google for the right strategies to solve a problem, or gamble against RNG (where it feels like the house always wins). The ranks help our friends in the community who have families and/or full time jobs, or who are deep in finals territory at college. Sometimes you just want to log in, grab some bounties, shoot some aliens (or Guardians), earn XP, and chill with your friends.


That’s why we’ve added 100 ranks to earn each Season, with Free and Premium track rewards, plus a UX design that’s intuitive and familiar if you play other games. Unlike those other games, you’ll make progress by earning XP doing the things you’re already doing in *Destiny*—defeating monsters and completing bounties and activities. This is about a new additive layer of predictable rewards for just playing the game.


Here’s a look at the Season Pass UI:


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126826/season_pass_EN.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/ipFzfGI.jpg)


**It’s All Part of the Season**

With every Season Pass, you will get everything you’d expect from a *Destiny* Season (new activities, rewards, a storyline, et cetera), not just the new Season Rank UI and the reward tracks. Like I alluded to way back in the first Director’s Cut, we need more sustainable ways to deliver rewards, and the Season Rank UI is a big step in us getting there.


So now, with all this context, let’s look at what you Season Pass owners get in Season of the Undying (which, again, is included with *Shadowkeep*):


* Season Pass owners get access to a new seasonal activity, the Vex Offensive, which includes:

   * Four Legendary Weapon drops
   * Additional weekly and daily bounties
   * Additional weekly challenges with powerful rewards


* A new weapon quest for an Exotic Bow, Leviathan’s Breath

   * Exclusive to Season Pass owners


* A new Exotic Hand Cannon, Eriana’s Vow

   * Awarded on Rank 35 of the free track
   * Awarded on Rank 1 of the premium track


* Three seasonal Legendary armor sets (one for each class)

   * Collect a complete set during the first 25 ranks of the free track

      * NOTE: This is a change from the Annual Pass, where you were required to purchase gear from the Season.
   * On the premium track you get all three sets on Rank 1
   * These also drop within the Vex Offensive seasonal activity

      * If you want versions with higher stat tiers, you’ll need to play Vex Offensive to earn them


* Some additional premium track rewards: 

   * Three universal ornament armor sets (one for each class)
   * An Exotic weapon ornament for Eriana’s Vow
   * Two Legendary weapon ornaments 
   * A new finisher
   * An Exotic emote 
   * An Exotic ship


**Progression, or How Differently You All Play Destiny**

For many of us, *Destiny 2* is a regular hobby, but how that hobby fits in with our lives is different. We have players who play every day, we have players who have 10–15 hours a week, and we have players who log in for whatever time they can spare. Every season, *Destiny 2* will change, and the community working on changing the world together means that we want all of our community to be able to be a part of it.


Some other games let players buy every rank when a new Season begins. In *Destiny*, we want your time spent playing the game to matter; we want the first players who unlock a bunch of the sweet stuff to have unlocked it through play, not pay. Some players are going to work super hard trying reach rank 100 as quickly as possible. We think that’s great.


But again, all of you play *Destiny 2* differently, and when we say we want the whole community to be part of how the world changes every season, we keep coming back to giving players the choice of how they want to spend their time. Based on how a lot of you play, 100 ranks is going to be cleared in the season, but not all of you will have the time.


To solve for how our community plays *Destiny*, we’re planning to allow Season Ranks to be purchased as a catch-up mechanic late in the season. We’re going to wait to see how players engage with Season Ranks and make sure it’s tuned well before determining exactly when we unlock the ability.


Season of the Undying runs for 10 weeks, and we’re currently thinking of enabling this somewhere in the last 2–4 weeks of the Season. We know that sometimes life gets in the way, and you just want to get the last few rewards before the season ends and everything resets. In the same way that we’ve been doing seasonal catch-up for Power, we think providing a late-in-the-season rank catch up makes sense. This initial version is our starting point, and the way we’ve designed Seasons moving forward means that we’re going to be able to have the flexibility to tune how this works once we see how Season of the Undying goes.


I see you: “Did Bungie just raise the XP needed to get a rank to some ridiculous level so that players have to buy ranks at the end of the season?” The answer to that question is **NO**. For example, in our internal team tests, playing strikes in a fairly relaxed manner (18 minutes per strike play time) with full stacks of bounties can get a Seasonal Rank in less than one hour. Every week, Guardians also get rest XP bonuses (per account), where their first three ranks are at triple XP. Playing strikes with full stacks of bounties and rest XP should get 10 ranks in around 8 hours. And knowing you, we’ll all see even better ways you’ll min-max your time to clear your ranks.


Our goal in tuning this is for our most committed *Destiny* players, who start on week 1, to reach Rank 100 simply by doing the things they already love spending their time on. If that’s not happening, we have the freedom and ability to adjust. We want *Destiny* to be your home however you want to play and hit 100. You may never want or need to buy a rank. We just want our community to be able to play together as easily as possible and narratively be part of the *Destiny* world as it changes.


Your Seasonal Rank also goes away at the end of the Season—a new Season of ranks and rewards will take its place. And like our Seasonal Activities, we don’t want important gameplay-focused rewards to be inaccessible to players who missed a season, so any Legendary or Exotic weapons introduced in a Season Pass will be attainable in future Seasons. Those coveted rewards won’t be available immediately, but it won’t take longer than six months either. More details on that soon.


***New Light, Removing Barriers for Friends, and $0**

We’ve talked a lot about what you get if you buy the Season Pass, but let’s talk about what you get with *Destiny 2* for spending nothing. This fall, new friends playing *Destiny 2* for the first time are coming, and we’re going to make *Destiny* a great experience for everyone. At its core, what makes *Destiny 2* special and a place we all come back to is the community, the friendships, and the memories made along the way. *Destiny* is best if you can convince your friends to play, and we think a $0 price tag is another way to make that easier. The default version of *Destiny 2* this fall will be *New Light*, and on top of all of D2Y1 available for free with *New Light*, we’re going to make sure there’s plenty of new, free content in Season of the Undying. Here’s some of what all players (even without the season pass) can access on October 1:


Alt: All *Destiny 2* players, whether you’re coming in with *New Light* or are all-in on *Shadowkeep* and Season of the Undying, will have access to the following:


* Patrolling the Moon destination
* The opening mission of *Shadowkeep*  
* Two new strikes
* Crucible Updates (which I discussed in [link to previous Director’s Cut])
* Two returning PvP maps from the D1 era—Widow’s Court and Twilight Gap
* Elimination in Crucible Labs
* Armor 2.0 build customization
* Eye of the Gate Lord Seasonal Artifact
* New finishers
* Two new pinnacle weapons: one for Gambit and one for Crucible
* Free Seasonal Rank rewards, which include:

   * New Exotic weapon—Eriana’s Vow
   * Three Legendary armor sets (1 per class)
   * Two Legendary weapons
   * Best of Year 2 Bright Engrams 
   * Glimmer and upgrade modules


The Legendary armor and weapons that come with the free Seasonal Ranks are like sampler platters for the Season Pass. If you want to find the best stat rolls for that armor, you will need to play the Seasonal activity and get the drops. But players who just want to collect all of the armor can earn the base version from the free track.


Eriana’s Vow, the new Exotic on our Seasonal track also drops on the free track (but you get it earlier if you have the Season Pass). We have also added a lot of rewards on the free track that are nice quality-of-life rewards for players, like upgrade modules, which are free Infusions.


**How This Could’ve Worked Last Year**

This has been a pretty dense dump of information (thankfully it has more pictures than the Director’s Cuts did). I wanted to wrap this up by looking at how a season of content done in the style of Year 3 might’ve worked with some Year 2 content we all remember. 


Let’s re-imagine the Season of the Forge in Year X of Bizzaro-*Destiny*


*(begin Wayne’s World do-loo-loo-loo)*


A week before the Season begins, all players receive a note in their mailbox. It simply reads: “I have returned from the stars. Meet me on Dec. 4 at 10:15 AM PST. —Ada” Once this note has been given out, a small countdown timer appears on the Traveler. When the timer reaches 0, players in the Tower see a ship unlike any they’ve ever seen land between Zavala and Lord Shaxx. A figure transmats out and walks through the Tower, opening a door that had long been shut. Players follow the character through the Tower and the figure lowers her hood and greets players, “I am Ada, and we have work to do.”


The Season Pass in the Director is updated, the rewards are revealed, and now Ada and players begin a Season-long experience of refining forges in the world, completing bounties, finding materials, working on Black Armory armor sets, and taking on the new raid, Scourge of the Past. In a twist, Datto and his group are the first to finish.


As players work together to forge weapons early in the track, smithing and building new ones, the room around Ada begins to change. The schematic data from players’ work is resulting in new weapons and mods for players to create. These weapons and mods don’t all require playing the Seasonal activity—some of them are found in new encounters within strikes, some of them are forged in Last Wish (like the Alchemy Lab in Blackwing Lair).


As the player community plays, meta objectives are revealed. Once a certain number of players have unlocked ranks on the Pass, cinematics unlock for everyone to watch. We see the Drifter and Ada arguing over something pitting the two against each other, the scene ends with Drifter raising an eyebrow at a set of gun schematics behind Ada.


As the Season winds to a close, the Drifter begins to summon players to him. He’s having a new space built in the Tower, and the first people he asks for help are those who’ve earned the title of Dredgen. Now players begin to gather materials and donate them to fund the Drifter’s new scam. The Drifter won’t stop talking about the gun schematics he saw behind Ada.


Very late in the Season, players notice Ada’s room looks like it’s being packed up. She’s leaving. The schematics that sat behind her are missing. Over the course of a few weeks, she packs her equipment and, in an event similar to her arrival, she vanishes. Ada, her wares, and her forges are gone.


Banshee-44 reminds players that even though Ada is gone, she left him the schematics for her weapons and armor, and he’ll be rotating them through over time.


And the Drifter asks you to visit him, saying he’s got a surprise…


*(end Wayne’s World do-loo-loo-loo)*


And while today, the “Let’s Pretend” section above is very much a work of fiction, we are working to build the technology that would make something like this possible and help make our Season Pass feel uniquely *Destiny*.


**Wrap-Up**

Season Passes in Year 3 will in some ways feel very new and in other ways feel pretty similar to the *Forsaken* Annual Pass experience. Our intent is that the Season Pass mechanics—as we’re aligning everything with a single, evolving world and how we’re moving the *Destiny* story meaningfully forward—are additive to the core *Destiny* experience (we’re still going to have things like Holiday events, dungeons and secret missions, and all kinds of stuff that we hope surprises you!). It’s an evolution and an experiment, and hopefully what you’ve seen lately is that we’re going to keep being agile and continuing to make the best decisions for the game along with you. We’re excited to see where our unified seasonal philosophy will let us take the *Destiny* universe over the next year.


(Also, thanks for all of the comments and responses to the Director’s Cuts—I have some deleted scenes and ideas on how the format could evolve when it returns next year!)


See you soon, 

Luke Smith

Hey everyone,


This is Director’s Cut – Part II, a now mega-long update looking at the last six months of *Destiny 2* and looking ahead to *Shadowkeep*, and maybe a bit beyond. If you missed Part I and have an afternoon to yourself, [go check it out](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48058).


As the first section grew in length, I figured this section would be the last one. But at some point Avengers wasn’t going to be split into *Infinity War* and *Endgame*, either. So there will be another part. I love you 3000. 


**Looking Ahead (to Shadowkeep)**

This fall is a necessary first step in turning Destiny 2 into the game we want it to be. 


It’s been a busy year, so let’s recap: 



* We assumed publishing control of Destiny and wanted to get something new into your hands as quickly as possible (*Shadowkeep*!)
* We paired it with a free entry point in *New Light* to welcome new Guardians into the fold. 
* We wanted to bring Destiny 2 to new platforms to keep heading toward the you can play Destiny anywhere dream (Steam and Google Stadia). 
* We’re taking the initial steps toward building Destiny as a single, evolving world. 
* And we’re doing all of this while cranking on a bunch of the systems changes we’ve talked about and will continue to talk about heading into Shadowkeep. 


Here’s where we’re going this fall.


***



##The Care and Feeding of the RPG: Add Depth, Improve Customization

We want to give people who love the RPG aspect of Destiny (like many of us) more stats and depth on the character sheet to sink their teeth into. We want to give players more agency over how they look. We also want armor to have that deep pursuit players love about *Destiny*—which brings the victory of finding their perfect roll.


**Let’s Talk About Armor, Part I: Mods, Stats, and Tradeoffs**

In order to allow players to independently pursue gameplay mods and further customize their Guardian fashion, a lot of work has been done to update armor for this fall. We’ve refactored a number of the stats in the game, we’ve overhauled the UI, and we’ve begun to separate capabilities from aesthetics.


***Time-out. ***


Before I go on, I want to interject: It seems like some comments from part I around MTX are being misconstrued. Maybe I wasn’t clear enough. Maybe it felt too ambiguous. Let me try and clear this up before we get into armor. 


*Destiny* has and will continue to have Weapons, Armor, Ghosts, Ships, Sparrows, and Shaders that you can earn from activities to prove to the people looking at your character that you *did the thing*, whatever that thing is: I beat the Raid a bunch; I earned Iron Banner gear; I played a ton of Crucible; I wanted to gather rain in my shoulder pads so I played Gambit a ton; I made a sweet set of Astroshaman gear at the Rune table; I farmed that Strike for the Mindbender roll that makes people rage; et cetera. 


Let me be crystal clear: **That isn’t changing**. 


What we are doing with the new armor system is saying: Find the perks you want, find the armor look you want, (from the megalist of currently available Destiny 2 armor) and pursue that armor to get the elements/stats you want and combine them to make your Guardian. 


*Destiny* also has an MTX store that houses things like Sparrows, Ships, Emotes, Ghost Holograms, Weapon and Universal Ornaments. The items in that store rotate and can be purchased with Silver or Bright Dust. And starting this fall, Bright Dust is just another in-game currency that you can earn by completing Bounties, instead of buying a bunch of engrams and sharding them to generate Dust. 


In *Shadowkeep*, there are armor sets, weapons, Ghost, Ships, and Sparrows coming from the destinations and activities. 


***Time-in. Back to Armor.***


We started out by looking at what period in *Destiny’s* history was a good starting place for evolving the stat game (we felt like it was *The Taken King/Rise of Iron*) and what principles were guiding our new designs (we want to separate gameplay and aesthetics to grant more agency over both).


There was a deep dive stream about this topic on August 14, but let’s recap some of the high-level points.



* Armor now has an Energy meter ranging from 1–10. 
* You can use materials and currency to level up the Energy value on a given piece of armor. 
* Mods have both an Energy cost and an elemental affinity. In order for a mod to be equipped, your armor needs to have rolled the correct element and have enough Energy available  (e.g., Hand Cannon Reloader costs three Void Energy to equip, so your armor must have rolled Void and have three Energy available in order to use it). 
* Fundamentally, this means we have additional vectors for tuning things like mods. We could tune their effect (how much speed does the reload effect add?), we could tune their cost (how expensive is this mod to socket?), we could add mods to the pool for a different affinity, et cetera. 
* When you acquire a mod from the game, it’s like getting a perk that you can put on all armor. So once you’ve found Enhanced Hand Cannon Reloader from pinnacle activities (enhanced perks will come only from pinnacle activities), you’ll be able to socket that mod into new armor that meets its criteria (the mod is *not consumed* and can be socketed in and out at a small cost). 


Here are the elements of armor that can roll randomly: 



* Elemental affinity rolls between Solar, Arc, and Void 
* Armor’s starting Energy value can roll randomly as well (they can all be leveled to 10)
* Stats all roll random values (intellect, discipline, strength, mobility, resilience, and recovery) 


Like in *The Taken King*, the stats will have break points that decrease their cooldowns (yes, your Sparrow now shows up on the character sheet).


[Image Link](https://www.bungie.net/pubassets/pkgs/126/126411/Strength_English.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/sgl2tlw.jpg)


*Begin Math Time:*


Today in *Destiny 2*, the base recharge rates convert to a stat value of 30 in the new system. Getting to 30 isn’t too difficult, though of course some people (but certainly not you!) will ride the RNG roller coaster to get the stat they really want to 30. By chasing a good stat roll, you can achieve the fast recharge rates available in the game today *without needing to use mods*. It is totally possible to put together a +100 intellect build (100 is the cap) without socketing a single mod. Some of the new mods will provide +10 to a given stat to help you shore up stats you care about. 


But, that specialization may come with a price. Because you’ve specialized in intellect, you may be making tradeoffs for other stats (e.g., grenades come back slower or something—it really depends on your stat rolls). But if your grenades came back slower, then maybe that Demolitionist perk that you’ve been dismantling (I know, I know, Demolitionist is actually pretty good on non-Primary weapons!) would start to look appealing. 


*End Math Time.*


We’ve made a bunch of armor in Destiny, and we didn’t want to leave behind any of the armor that players can currently pursue. So, we’ve also updated every new drop in the game to integrate and leverage the new system. This means if you want to go back and get the small Titan shoulder pads from Sloane on Titan, you can go chase a roll of them that uses the new system. 


A number of the current mods will not work in the new armor that’s dropping this fall. But those mods aren’t being deprecated at this time. For example, your Super mods on your current armor will still work, but Super mods cannot be socketed into the new armor (you could socket your armor with intellect mods instead, though).


We did this because, while we think the evolutions we’re making to armor are a great step for Destiny over the long haul, we want you to decide when you migrate to them. 


**Part II: The Armor Migration**

Amplifying depth and choice via the new stats system ushers in some changes to armor. We’ve converted all current *Destiny* armor to use the stats, so cooldown durations will change as we migrate to the new system. You’ll be able to see the cooldown timers of your legacy armor when *Shadowkeep’s* patch goes live. 


Here’s what we don’t want to happen: you feeling like “the game deprecated my old armor and perks; that time I spent playing Forsaken and its Annual Pass content was a waste, since all of the perks on the armor got turned off while Bungie forcibly migrated to this new system.”


Here’s how we hope this works:


If you’re a pretty hardcore player (or really lucky!) and have a set of armor today with perfect-for-you perks (like a fully loaded Enhanced Gun You Like set of perks), I think you’re going to keep using them for a while. I certainly expect the World First raid teams are going to go in with Forsaken-era gear that they’ve infused up throughout their *Shadowkeep* Power progression. 


As the weeks go by and players approach the *Shadowkeep* Power cap and start finding mods with enhanced perks, we think that’s when our most invested, progression-chasing players will start to move over. Players can totally mix and match between new armor and the armor they have today as well. 


For players without perfectly rolled gear, we think the transition to the new armor system is one they’ll make pretty quickly. In our long-form playtesting, our internal teams (not Velveeta—these are other internal players and playtesters. Sidebar: I’m real disappointed I missed out on the “kraftiest” opportunity in Part I. Good catch, Reddit!) have found that they’ve used their current armor on their “main” Guardian but rapidly switched to Armor 2.0 on their less-played alts. 


*Remember LiveJournal? Let’s do it.*


With how I play, it’s a crude mix of fashion, function, and economic efficiency. I rarely invest resources in an item until it’s an item I know I want to use. I don’t infuse very often unless I need a specific piece/roll for an activity. I do not have a favorite class, I play all three. I tend to rotate them based on what is most effective or needed for group play in a given moment. I personally love it when the game gets hard, and I feel as if we would benefit from more challenge (I really liked how Contest mode enforced an action game skill component on World First attempts!). I totally have my favorite weapon archetypes (which I’ll spare you), and I get really frustrated as a player when there is an archetype I feel like I *absolutely have to use all the time because it is far and away the most efficient thing*. This is because I do—when playing content that matters—have to be using the most efficient thing. This creates some interesting discussions with the team at work when they create something that is super fun but isn’t actually efficient to use. I will totally mess around and get a triple double in patrol with a weird weapon, but the weird stuff isn’t getting used in a Crown of Sorrows group early in the season. Even then, I want to get through that content as quickly as I can. 


My characters generally look HIDEOUS on the climb, and then I start to make them look good again once I get to the end game (and since I’m color-blind, my friends think my characters look pretty hideous in the end game, too). I think for me, I’ll shelve my nicely rolled items, delete everything that I wouldn’t wear raiding, and start using new equipment while I power up and find some looks I like—and then, when it’s time to go on JacketQuest, I’ll infuse up my well-rolled raiding equipment. 


*End of LiveJournal post.*


Back to what I started this with—we want the transition to ultimately be your choice, one that you decide to make *when* you want to make it. Maybe you’re ready to start tinkering with stats. Maybe you really want to start combining universal ornaments and currently dropping armor to up your fashion game. Or maybe, like me, you’ll do both at the same time (but hopefully with less mocking from your so-called friends).

##The Pursuit of Power: Increasing Player Agency 

We’d like the act of chasing Power and stats for your build to be something you have a bit more agency over. Not a full-blown “play whatever you want all the time”—because that means people just find the most efficient thing, rather than dipping their toes into a bunch of different activities—but certainly less restrictive than it’s been in the past. 


We’ve also had a long-standing challenge in *Destiny* of making XP matter, and that feels like a real growth opportunity for us to dig into something we’ve wanted to look at for a while. 


This section discusses Power and the changes coming to it this Fall.  


**Part I: Powerful Sources, Primes, and the World**

Like I mentioned in [Part I](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48058), the number of powerful sources in *Destiny 2* ballooned during the annual pass. We’re curating down the sources in *Shadowkeep*. Our target is to get the number of powerful sources closer to *Forsaken*-launch levels. In *Forsaken*, as you over-leveled an activity (meaning your Power gets higher than the activity), the activity’s rewards would become less valuable (the inverse was also true for being under-leveled). In *Shadowkeep*, we’ve changed that. Instead, the system will advertise a consistent expected powerful reward, regardless of your Power relative to it. 


Over the years, we’ve come to discuss several parts of *Destiny* in terms of short-, medium-, and long-term goals.


In the simplest terms: Short-term goals can be completed in a night or a week, medium-term goals can take several weeks, and long-term goals can take anywhere from a Season to several Seasons. For some folks (like me), getting good at a part of the game may take a lifetime (that’s a personal-mastery goal).


We think reaching max Power can be a medium-term goal for Power-progression-focused players. For those players, we hope pursuit of stats and someday trying out new builds is their long-term goal. I say “someday,” because while we’re taking our first steps in buildcrafting with a new armor/mod framework this Fall, I think we’re going to learn a bunch about what making a viable build in Destiny requires. You’re going to surprise us with crazy, creative things we’ve never seen once this is live—we’re all looking forward to it. 


Prime Engrams

We’re doing some minor housekeeping on Prime Engrams. They’ll begin dropping once you hit 900, and you’ll accumulate charges for them as you make your way from 750 to 900. We’ve increased the number of Prime Engrams you can earn in a given week and rebalanced the value of each one to account for the increase in volume.


World Drops

As far as contributing to your Power level, world drops often feel like a waste. To get away from that, we’ve made some changes that allow these drops to help players progress beyond the soft cap. World drops in *Shadowkeep* will have a chance to drop at a player’s current Power level. 


Here’s an example: A player has an overall Power level of 912. Gloves are their lowest slot at 906. A player might open a Legendary engram and receive 912 gloves (an increase of 6 Power). 


We’re making this change because we feel like the world Legendaries are a little undervalued at the moment. This isn’t some grand accelerant for Power progression, but rather a little quality-of-life experiment to reward your free-roaming adventures or random Legendary-activity drops.


**Part II: Preparing for *New Light***

One of the essential parts of *New Light* is crushing the barriers between friends. Today, one of those barriers is the Power level. 


To players, Power level can mean “we have different goals, so we don't play together.” A new character starting at 10 Power would naturally feel that they had to go play all this other content—and in many, many hours you can play with the friend who recommended the game to you. 


That does not sound very sweet. It’s like telling someone to play a MOBA and then saying “we’ll play with you in 100 hours when you’ve learned to last hit.” (This is what my friends said to me. Do I have bad friends? As I’m writing this, I’m starting to wonder.)


That’s not what we want in *New Light*. 


We want to get new players and veterans colliding quickly. After Black Armory, we made a deliberate choice to try to do this with each Season. Both Season of the Drifter and Season of Opulence had bounties to boost up players’ Power levels. With New Light and *Shadowkeep* being bigger moments of collision, we’re continuing that philosophy, but optimizing the mechanics to fit the moment. 


We’re setting the Power this Fall to 750 for both returning and new players. We want you to all be together when *Shadowkeep* opens. Here’s what this means: 



* Every single item in the game is being raised to a Power floor of 750 when Shadowkeep and New Light launch. Every item in your inventory (and vault) is going to automatically jump to 750. 
* It's like a free global burst of infusion for all players. 


Which means that right now, you could (should!) *stop spending currency to infuse your gear sets* or that C-tier of weapons that you're keeping around until the patch notes just in case they are going to be good after the changes (there are many buffs coming and it is *very tempting to spoil a bunch of them*, but I said this wasn’t gonna be the patch notes!).


**Part III: More Power, More Problems **

(We originally had this as Mo’ instead of More, but I changed it upon the sad realization that there is an entire generation of players who missed out on Biggie, Puffy, and Mase in the Bad Boy era. Yes, it’s kind of weird that I changed this and left the Highlander reference in. Especially when neither is T for Teen.)


I’m the first to say it: Raising the Power of all players globally is indicative of a greater problem. It’s real weird that someone will boot up *New Light* for the first time and immediately be 750.  


The capital P Power level in Destiny (or Light as it was called in D1) has been asked to do a lot over the years. For a time in *Destiny 1*, it was one of the only things players had to pursue. In D1, Power/Light meant something in terms of achievement—but that badge of honor had its problems (forever 29 via raid boots, etc). 


*Destiny 1* put the Light/Power level over the player’s head and drove players to raid and raise it. Over time, we gave players other paths to raising their Light/Power (Nightfall, Iron Banner). We took Light off the nameplate and made it three digits in *The Taken King*, trying to turn Light into something more like a three-digit item level, but without the stat budgeting assigned to it where the stats dictate true character power. 


At D2 launch, we shortened the Power climb, over-simplified the game, made it too easy to get items, focused on bringing new players in, and hoped that players would pursue looks alone as their endgame (we were wrong!) while we continued to build features like what would become *Forsaken* Triumphs. 


During that period, we also democratized Power so that players didn’t need to raid or play Nightfall to reach max Power. They could kind of just do any weekly. *Forsaken* introduced gold sources onto the map, and over the course of the year, the number of powerful sources continued to increase. 


See, Power has a lot to do with the amount of damage players can both deal and receive. In fact, it's the biggest factor in it. It’s also been *the thing* to pursue. Our gameplay specialists—the roles where dedicated Destiny players come in and participate in long-form playtesting with their imported-from-home character—frequently point out that they can’t engage with a number of parts of the game ’til they’ve “completed the Power climb.” Over the years, we’ve made the Power climb shorter and shorter. We’ve made it easier and easier to reach max Power.


We’ve also introduced things like Triumphs, titles, and Collections to provide additional stuff to do as the prestige of Power waned.


In *Shadowkeep*, we’re trying something a little different. 


First, we’re introducing a Seasonal Artifact, unique and thematic to each Season. 


As the artifact levels up, it can do a few things: First, it becomes a source of seasonal artifact mods—unique mods that can be equipped only during that Artifact’s season. These mods may be brand new experimental mods or powerful mods with reduced energy cost enabling players (and us!) to experiment further in the buildcrafting space.


Second, the seasonal artifact can award players a Power bonus, but that bonus is not applied to gear (nor does it increase the Power of future drops), but instead to all of your characters. This is meant to give players who can’t or don’t want to play pinnacle activities a seasonal path to Power. This way, even if a player doesn’t play the raid, Iron Banner, or the [REDACTED], they can still have a high Power value for the Season. Leveling the artifact to raise your Power is meant to be Seasonal character growth. Each Season, we’ll have a new artifact with new mods that change how you play—and the Power bonus will reset.


In addition to curating the list of powerful sources, *Shadowkeep* will also introduce pinnacle powerful sources. These sources are the only way to earn gear drops above power 950 in Season 8. 


Here's the thinking: Pinnacle reward sites can award players Power above 950. This is a way of reclaiming a little bit of the character Power prestige that the initial D1 Power climb created. If you inspect a player and see their gear is 960, you know they’ve done a bunch of pinnacle activities. It’s worth mentioning that as you raise your Power via pinnacle activities, other powerful reward sites will continue to drop powerful sidegrades. 


All of this said, Power in *Destiny 2* is still imperfect. We’re making some adjustments to it this year for *Shadowkeep*: things like Seasonal Power bonuses and pinnacle activities awarding pinnacle Power. But when we look to the future, we feel like the Power system may benefit from a rework further down the road. There’s real potential in creating more agency for players, figuring out if Power should be prestigious or not, and taking on the challenge of how to keep players relatively close together Season after Season, while still allowing them to make progress. 


Here’s something I miss from *Destiny 1*: filling bars on my items and using materials to level items. Even though I ended up with more ascendant and radiant materials than I ever could’ve needed, the existence of these materials meant the hunt for powerful rolls could go on longer. I think wanting and needing materials is a good thing—as long as you know what you can do to go pursue that material. I’m glad we’re getting a little more of that back into *Destiny* with *Shadowkeep*.


Need Masterwork Cores? Well, we didn’t have a very good answer for that much of the year. Lesson learned. 


Stay tuned to bungie.net for the third installment of Director’s Cut. It focuses on the action part of MMO-action game (think: combat and PvP, with a bonus section on the evolving world) coming to *Destiny* this Fall. 


See you soon, 

Luke Smith

I'm so glad they're putting everyone at 750. I've mained a titan for a long time, and have neglected my alts. I'd like to swap mains going forward. This is the perfect catalyst to do so.

You in pinnacle activities you said “raid, IB or [Redacted]...

Am I to understand that the nightfall will not be considered a pinnacle activity and therefor will not drop enhanced mods?  This sounds really disappointing...

Also, am I to understand that a new, non-raid game mode will be considered pinnacle and WILL drop enhanced mods?  Will that mode remain pinnacle when the season after it drops, or will something else replace it as a new pinnacle raid alternative? 

Just looking for a little clarity here... not asking for you to tell me what the game mode is...

So what is going to happen to all the weekly activities making them redundant after a certain point is forcing players they either can't or don't want to do e.g. I know people that are older than I am and reaction times are slower than most people so when activities like PvP they try to avoid because they just can't compete with younger more skilled players. Don't make activities pointless.

Hey everyone,


Setting aside the tricks our memories play on us, things are often clearer in hindsight than when we’re looking ahead. The recent past is clear, loaded with learnings from the mistakes we make, and the future is fuzzy, hopeful, and unknown. As we readied last year’s Director’s Cut, we had made a number of changes to the game and wanted to give you all some insight as to *why* we made those changes. 


Each Director’s Cut is a chance to acknowledge and own the learnings from the past (when the wounds are fresh) and give a glimpse at tomorrow. 


This edition is arriving a little earlier in the development process for how we’re thinking about Year 4 (and beyond) and, while some of the changes the game needs are clear to us, there are others we’re still thinking about. Last summer’s payload covered a wide-range of topics that ended up touching on almost the whole game. Today’s DC is going to look in depth at just a couple of topics: how our philosophy on Seasons is evolving and the problems with weapons that last forever, with some additional quick-hit topics at the end. 


This isn’t exhaustive, we know there’s more going on in the game than below. And there will be more to talk about later in the year.


Before we look ahead, let’s look back one more time. 2019 was about a few things for Bungie and Destiny: 


**Asserting our vision for Destiny.** It’s an action MMO, in a single evolving world, that you can play anytime, anywhere with your friends. It’s a game we want to keep building on, and to do so with creative and **work/life sustainability.** Without our team’s talents, there isn’t a Destiny. And while that seems OBVIOUS to say, I think it’s pretty easy to lose sight of amidst the “This was awesome”/“This was not so awesome” reactions to entertainment. As I covered at length last year, the way we built the Annual Pass wouldn’t work for us over the long haul. We had a *lot* of help and person-power from our awesome (and now former) partners. We needed to find a better way forward, while preserving the player experience and our business, because we are now **self-publishing Destiny.** That was a big lift for Bungie in 2019. 


When I think about the total scope of that work and the sheer force of will the team demonstrated to deliver in 2019, I feel pretty good about what we achieved (usually, this is where we’d list all of the positives but, instead, let’s use the word count to improve on the past and look ahead to the future). 


As we began 2020, much of the existential dread of “Will we make it out of this transition?” is gone. We’ve clarified our vision for Destiny and are working toward the future with that vision in mind. For me personally, the drive home each night isn’t focused on “Will Bungie survive?” like before. Now it’s “Where can Destiny go?” and “How can we get there?” 


When I came back from the holiday this year, something about Destiny felt off to me. Season 9 is – to me – the best winter season we’ve done in Destiny 2. But something felt missing. And that missing element is what I think we need to focus on throughout 2020 and into 2021. 


>
>*Aspiration: 1. A hope or ambition of achieving something. 2. The action or process of drawing breath. *


In Destiny 2, aspiration is what keeps our game alive. It is the air that fills its lungs, it is the breath that gives the game meaning. Aspiration can be about entering Destiny 2 for the first time and feeling the potential of what you could become. It can be about the pursuits in front of you. Or it can also be PVP players looking over the horizon and seeing the Lighthouse and its treasures awaiting them – if they pass The Trials. 


Aspiration isn’t something reserved for the elite or the engaged; it’s for everyone (although when I listen to players express the feeling that, “There’s so much to do and none of it matters,” I feel that pain). It’s about the potential of a game to be more than something that just fills your time. It’s about having goals and working toward something that *matters* to you. I’m not so naïve as to think we can make something that matters to everyone – we all have different values, goals, and time. But I do think Destiny 2 can do a better job of enabling players to set short-, medium-, and long-term goals to work toward. 


As a player, aspiration is something I feel so strongly about. It’s the difference between a game I fall in love with and a game I consume like junk food. 


Last year, we started thinking about aspiration and what is missing from Destiny. The gaping, burning-eye-shaped hole is something I’d felt since we set Trials aside early in D2. Its return is part of a bigger goal for Destiny moving into 2020 and beyond: 


We need to refuel aspiration in Destiny 2. 


And a bunch of what we’re going to cover in this edition of the Director’s Cut is going to orbit this.

##Seasons of Change

With a few Seasons under our belt since Shadowkeep, we’re well underway on internal discussions around how we feel about them. We look at these iterations through a bunch of lenses. First, there’s the soft, smushy, “How do we *feel* about Seasons?” These feelings are mined from our own experiences and from ongoing roll-ups of information from our Community. We also look at how well Seasons are engaging our players. Are people coming back each week? How long are they playing? What do we look like month-over-month and how does it perform against our historical data? Then we start to talk about where to take Seasons in Year 4. Looking back, there is some good stuff and things we need to work on.


 Let’s start with what’s been working well. 


* Our Seasonal narratives are starting to connect to one another. The transition to Season 10 – with the community getting involved by donating Fractaline (in 100-count stacks accompanied by looooooooooong button holds [big shout out to the top 3 Fractaline donors in the world:  3jlowes, Dathan WarBucks and joshd29]) and lighting the Lighthouse – was a neat start at players working to move the world forward, ensuring that each story link in the Seasonal chain connects to the next and sets up where we’re heading. 
* The “Save a Legend” element of Season of Dawn was a nice deep cut for those who have been with Destiny since the beginning and a way to introduce the-ultimate-Titan-as-pigeon-superfan-slash-Guardian-orinthologist to many people who hadn’t found his grave the first time. Seeing your reactions was a highlight (and the team had a lot of fun building this one).
* I’ve enjoyed the simplicity of leveling up Destiny’s version of a Battle Pass. We wanted a progression that you could advance just by playing the game. (We don’t think we’ve got the whole XP thing figured out. Running in and out of Lost Sectors and flash-farming XP isn’t what we had in mind, but we can keep tuning it!) 


Speaking strictly about my own play patterns, I feel the need each Season to get all of the Pass’ Universal Ornaments and the title. I like knowing those cosmetics are unique and won’t be offered again. However, I find myself personally less motivated to try and get awesome rolls for the new weapons, which is especially strange considering I like having a “nice version” of each gun in Destiny.


Wanna do some weapon stuff now? There’s gonna be more weapon stuff later on, but let’s just chum the waters a little bit:


[INTERLUDE]

>I still really like playing this game. I’ve acquired almost every weapon in the game (whyyyyyyy Anarchyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy). I have some pretty slick rolls on a few of them and near-miss “internet-approved god rolls” on others (Spare Rations Rapid/Kill Clip and then Full Bore and a quick visit to Disappointown with Alloy Magazine). Like many of you, I end up gravitating to a few weapons and just using them instead of everything else. Sure, the Outlaw Multikill Clip Breachlight I farmed from Season of Dawn is nice to have (and I love the art for the Dawn weapon set) but is it really going to displace my go-to PVE kinetic weapons? Probably not. I know that.

[END INTERLUDE]


On the other hand:


We aren’t delivering the feeling of an evolving world. Instead we are delivering the feeling of ephemeral private activities and rewards that go away. The Forsaken Annual Pass had its share of challenges (see last year’s DC), but it also had this awesome property: If I stopped playing for a Season, when I came back, there were a bunch of rewards and activities that I could catch up on.  


What we’re discussing now – and which is early enough that things might still change – is how we focus our efforts around Seasons from a development standpoint, while also trying to create the moments that make memories, WHILE ALSO balancing the amount of “fear of missing out.” This is a tricky balance, because these elements don’t connect neatly and, in many cases, they work against one another. 


The wall of text below is how we’re thinking about things at the moment. We’re going to be continuing to take in the feedback our guts and data provides (your reactions and feedback are a part of that data, so do continue to let us know your thoughts) on our Seasonal model. Before we get into some more thoughts and details, I want to be extremely clear: 


This year’s version of Seasons has too much FOMO in them. We want to fix this, and next year’s Seasons will have less.


Because we aren’t spending our development resources and time as well as we could, we’re talking about moving away from creating Season-bespoke private activities and instead using that time and effort to build themes that aren’t just represented by a marquee event that will fade away, but rather to inject these Seasonal themes into more of the game. Like we continue to evolve the world’s narrative, we could invest more in the evolving world of our public spaces and take further efforts to evolve Destiny 2’s core activities. 


Core activities? What are those? 


Core activities are a way we think about a player’s options and motivations in a given evening of Destiny. They are meant to be more evergreen (quest/campaign content, for instance, is not generally evergreen). It’s usually something matchmade and designed with replayability in mind, either from the properties of the activity itself or the rewards. For example Crucible is fundamentally replayable because the opponents can be different and other players are the ultimate A.I., where The Ordeal is fundamentally replayable because of its reward structure, rather than random encounter generation. (In fact, we hope The Ordeal is consistent within a given week to create mastery and efficiency in defeating it). 


Ideally, core activities are convergence points for player motivations (e.g., “I want to maximize XP, chase awesome items, and generate economy that I can use to further my goals” [Yes, I know no one talks this way]). 


Right now, our Seasonal Activities (like Sundial) compete with the core activities. They have new rewards and award players powerful gear, but they don’t provide a bunch of XP. Core activities provide a bunch of XP, but we all feel the pain of, “How many more Seasons will I get the Titan Rain-Catching shoulder pads from the Drifter?” What this competition means is that it can be really hard to line up a “night of optimizing” in Destiny because you’re being pulled in different directions by our design!


So what could investing more in core activities look like? It could mean more rewards being distributed into these activities or it could mean taking a theme for a Season and using it to galvanize Strikes. If we’re going to ask players to engage with these activities, we have an opportunity to leverage rewards throughout the Season. Imagine the armor sets or Sundial weapons being woven into core activity reward pools. Or imagine experiences like pursuing rolls for sweet weapons that could only be found in a given playlist as an end-of-match reward, like a Crucible Eyasluna. 


We also think we could invest more of our development time on our questlines. Right now, things like Sundial consume team resources and then fade away. Imagine instead that Seasonal questlines like “Save a Legend” didn’t go away in the following Season, but instead existed until the next Expansion releases. That way, as players drift in an out of the game, there’s a bunch of content building up for them to play when they return. 


Just as we continue to evolve the narrative of our world, we can continue to invest in evolving the world of open world public spaces (in case you’re unfamiliar, these are the spaces where you seamlessly see other players appear). We’ve built a world where players can encounter others, but we haven’t made a world with fights challenging enough where you feel like other players matter.

##Weapons Forever: The Problem 

OK. Let’s talk *more* about weapons. And let’s begin with how weapons have worked in Destiny 2. All the way back to Destiny 2 vanilla, every weapon you get is a weapon you can keep and infuse to raise its Power level indefinitely. Remember the waters I talked about chumming earlier? It’s time to eat. 


In Destiny 2, with infusion, it’s like having every card you own in Magic available and playable in all formats forever. It passively creates power creep (an ongoing Destiny problem), which also means our teams need to spend more and more of their time re-testing and supporting old stuff instead of making new stuff, it reduces player desire for new items (which dismantles aspiration like the shard-the-blues post-Crucible match ritual), and it means we ultimately create a ton of gear that doesn’t have any value beyond ticking the box on the “I Got It” checklist.


That isn’t value. It’s actually the opposite of value, because it’s work that we could be putting into making new stuff, or improving old stuff. 


Our combat team works extremely hard to make weapons feel unique. Each Legendary (and many blues) get their own flavors of special sauce. Sometimes it’s the way a gun sounds, sometimes it’s the insanely over budget range stat (HAND IN HAND), sometimes it’s the recoil pattern, sometimes it’s the art, sometimes it’s something indescribable that just makes an item resonate with our players. 


In an action game like Destiny, our weapons are feel-based extensions to the character. I’ve played MMOs and ARPGs where I get amazing weapons, but rarely have those weapons felt like an extension of my avatar. Certainly in an action game like Dark Souls or Sekiro, the weapons become a feel-based extension of my character, rather than a stat stick like Fang of Korialstrasz.


Remember many, many words ago (in previous DCs) when I talked about the collision between the action game and the RPG? Couple with that with our theme of aspiration and I believe we are approaching an inflection point for weapons and infusion in Destiny 2. 


We’ve made a lot of Magic cards, and we want you to keep the ones you love in your collection (as opposed to taking them and throwing them all away and having the Tower get destroyed again). And a bunch of those Magic cards could be playable around the world while free-roaming or in PVP formats. But where Power matters or aspirational activities are involved, we’re going to make some changes to Legendary weapons. 


There was a lot of learning to do when Destiny launched in 2014. But there was also some real good stuff in that game. I think back on a bunch of it fondly – almost wistfully at times. The weapons from the Vault of Glass could be powerful, unique, and rare. If you had Fatebringer, you probably had a bunch of Ascendant Shards to commemorate all of the times you didn’t get it. I miss those days, when rewards were rarer and so special that you celebrated (or hated!) when your friends got one. That’s in part because the design of the game gave them space to be *different*, space to be awesome. 


It’s hard to cleave out that space in the current version of Destiny 2. Weapons that are supposed to come from pinnacle activities like Raids or Trials don’t really have space to breathe. The answer can’t be “Just make them *better,*” because that approach ends up with the Reckoning situation I described last year. Now we had Pinnacle weapons, which were largely just talents that had Exotic-esque capabilities in Legendary-clothing. These weapons were typically the result of long pursuits and when they arrived in your hands they were pretty strong (sometimes hilariously strong; looking at you RECLUSE). It also meant the team spent significant time developing each one. 


If you imagine the abstract weapon space as a pyramid, those pinnacle weapons largely sat at the top of the pyramid. Most other Legendary weapons are down in a clump of “They aren’t really that different.” Why? Because when every Legendary item the team builds is going to be around forever, outliers get weeded out. 


Back to 2014: The Vault of Glass weapons could be memorable because we knew they weren’t going to be in the ecosystem for things like Trials, Nightfalls, and Raids forever. They’d naturally fall by the wayside because Power (Attack/Light in those days) would make them obsolete. 


In the world we’re imagining, we’ll have space at the top end to create powerful Legendary weapons. Legendaries that are just *better* than other items in the classification. We’ll be able to do that, because the design space for weapons will expand and contract over time. Items will enter the ecosystem, be able to be infused for some number of Seasons and beyond that, their power won’t be able to be raised. Our hope is that instead of having to account for a weapon’s viability forever when we create one, it can be easier to let something powerful exist in the ecosystem. And those potent weapons entering the ecosystem mean there’s more fun items to pursue. 


Changes like this also mean Legendary weapons (or their talents) that would be “shelved” could be reissued at a future date. Or could be brought back in fun ways by involving our community. The more specific nitty gritty for this will come a little bit further down the road but we wanted to get some of thinking behind it to you sooner rather than later. The simplest version of how it is going to work is: Legendary weapons will have fixed values for how high they can be infused. Those values will project the weapon’s viable-in-end-game lifespan and we think that lifespan is somewhere between 9 and 15 months. 


One final note: We are not applying this to Exotic weapons at this time. We want to iterate on the Legendary ecosystem first.

##Cosmic Gardeners

Last year, we said: 


*We want playing Destiny to feel like you're playing in a game world with true momentum, a universe that is going somewhere. A game where things are happening—not just in terms of new items and activities but also in terms of narrative. It’s frequently seemed like Destiny was treading water in terms of moving the world’s narrative forward. We want to tackle this in Destiny 2’s third year.*


That statement is still true for us today, as we look into D2Y4 and beyond. We started this in Year 3, but the job isn’t done. By its very nature this is something that really doesn’t have “an end.” The idea of building a narrative that is moving the story of your Guardians (plural, all of you!) forward, creating a universe where permanent change is possible, and where players can have meaningful impact, is still a thing we’re chasing and experimenting with. 


To get there, change is going to be inevitable (see above where I talked about how we’re thinking about adjusting the Seasonal model). We’ve said before that Destiny 2 cannot keep growing indefinitely. There are lots of reasons why this is true, some technical, and some creative, because the story wants to push into new areas. 


On the technical side, I come back to sustainability. As new areas, features, and event types are added to Destiny, the [problems of maintenance grow accordingly for the team](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Detail/News/48723). New changes to the system have to be checked against all content, new and old alike. That introduces risk and a big burden on our teams to maintain that legacy content. In practical terms, it also prevents us from responding to players who have problems as quickly as we would like.


Seasons can do some of the heavy lifting here, in the sense of giving players a sense of shared purpose and understanding of what they’re working for. But when we ready expansions, it’s a chance to make some more fundamental changes to the game world and its systems. We’ve done significant systems changes to all Destiny games every time we’ve shipped an expansion, and now we’re going to be making more changes to the game world as we go forward. 


We’re getting towards the end here but, before we wrap, here’s a few quick hits on some important topics.


***



##SHORTCUT #1: Faction Rallies

Lots of folks have been wondering if Faction Rallies will return. We have no plans to bring back Faction Rallies. The reward gear hasn’t been used that much, our character cast is growing too large, and crucially, they didn’t drive a bunch of engagement with the game. That said, there’s some sweet looks in that gear and we’re moving the Faction Rally armor to the Legendary engram reward pools in Season 10, alongside a few popular faction weapons. 


##SHORTCUT #2: Bright Engrams 

For Season 10, we’re doing away with Bright Engrams as purchasable items. We want players to know what something costs before they buy it. Bright Engrams don’t live up to that principle so we will no longer be selling them on the Eververse Store, though they will still appear on the Free Track of the Season Pass. 


##SHORTCUT #3: New Light, New Intro

Our goals for New Light last year were about bringing new players into the universe and getting them to the core activities as quickly as we could. We *dramatically* underestimated how many new Guardians would wake up on the Cosmodrome. We’re going to improve the New Light entry this fall and flesh the starting experience in Destiny out.  


##SHORTCUT #4: Questlog

There’s another round of changes coming out with Season 10 for the Quest tab. The number of Quests you have at any given time sure can feel daunting, especially for procrastinators, so we’re adding a new feature to the Quest tab – categorization. All Quests are automatically assigned a category, and this buckets them into a specific area within the Quest tab. 


For example, Exotic quests get their own category, as well as Seasonal quests. The Seasonal quest category is helpful in that it contains all of the quests that expire at the end of the Season. There are several categories, including one for older releases (e.g. Forsaken quests). This should help players focus on the quests that are new and most relevant vs. older content that maybe isn’t as high-priority as it used to be.

##Exit Music

Thanks for being here. I appreciate that you’re invested in the game enough (or excited enough about trolling) to sift through the text above. We’re early into 2020 and we’ve got some cool stuff planned. Shortly, Season 10 is entering orbit and there will be more to talk about as the calendar continues. A lot of work from a lot of folks goes into each time I, or anyone else from the dev team, talks about how we’re thinking about the game. Many thanks to them, and many thanks to *you* for being a part of this community. 


See you soon,

Luke Smith

So...how it always used to be before the last two seasons?

The question stumped me for a good few moments.

The fact that it had been delivered with little in the way of threatening undertones, and instead, spoken with an excitable straight face made the whole situation that much more bizarre.

“Well enough.” I responded bluntly. “My suit can handle an open flame at the very least.” I quickly added.

“Good, *good*!” The armorer spoke with an excitable clatter, as he now turned his attention to a particularly uncluttered part of the workshop right in front of us, a part of this grand space that I *knew* was a bit off from the very beginning.

It was just *too* unlike the surroundings, like one of those weirdly bright, luminous, clearly out-of-place objects in an ancient hand-drawn cartoon, or in one of those retro-classic video games; the *really* obvious parts of the background that you *knew* the character had to interact with.

“Right! Ten steps back and stand clear of the center of the room!” The man shouted, refusing to comply himself, as it was clear that his presence was needed to proceed with what I assumed was going to be a tour of the *real* guts of the workshop.

He held both of his permanently gloved hands out in front of him, above the lip of the circular area that had been marked out in the middle of the room.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 450% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

Then, just like that, the ground beneath us started quaking.

What was formerly a single solid piece of granite was now coming apart at the seams, revealing itself to be a series of carefully chiseled bricks whose edges were so seamless that they blended into a solid mass when pressed against each other.

Parts of the granite began levitating upwards, whilst others began descending downwards into the earth.

This was followed by a sharp, shrill, angry hissing as jets of superheated steam shot out from the gaps rapidly forming between the bricks, bathing the room in a blanket of thick white vapor which could’ve easily spelled the doom of anyone with unprotected skin or fur.

**ALERT: EXTERNAL TEMPERATURES EXCEEDING SAFE LEVELS. 200… 225… 297… 327 DEGREES CELSIUS. PASSIVE HEAT SHIELDING NOMINAL. INTERNAL TEMPERATURE CONTROL NOMINAL**.

Some sort of pressure seal had clearly been broken, and it was only thanks to some magic-based air ventilation system that the place just didn’t blow up in a violent display of gross engineering oversight.

It took a few seconds for the steam to clear, and a few more seconds for the stones to fully descend, forming an intricate spiral staircase that stretched down hundreds of feet straight into what I’d previously assumed had been nothing but packed dirt.

Except this didn’t just lead straight down into an inky black abyss like one would expect from a journey deep into a hidden room or a basement.

No.

In fact, it was the exact opposite.

As all I could see from this vantage point was light, an enormous amount of it. Which was quickly tempered by a rapid tinting of the helmet’s lenses, revealing hints of an entire world beneath the academy’s grounds.

With a wordless glance and a gesture for me to follow, we both began our descent downwards.

“Watch your step! None of this was designed with anyone but me in mind, so I wouldn’t want to be responsible for what happens to those fleshy insides should it plummet down a good two hundred or so feet!” The man announced jovially, acknowledging the distressing lack of any handrails or safety precautions that would’ve caused an OSHA inspector to go red in the face.

Whilst the sheer drop *was* nausea inducing, it didn’t bother me *too* much. On the logical side of things, I was assured by the fact that the suit's exoskeleton automatically compensated for each and every step. With any misstep or oversight on my part, simply overridden by its auto compensators. On the psychological side of things however, I honestly wasn’t too bothered either. All of those hours of recreational rooftop activities during middle and high school, and the compulsory training at the IAS in dealing with the psychological effects of height-sensitive operations, had made the sight of a sheer drop only mildly worrying.

To be honest, anyone who grew up in Acela with an ounce of interest in hobbies involving the outdoors, would already have been used to heights and vertigo. You would’ve *had to*, since most of the actual *outdoor* public spaces were typically zoned atop of megatower rooftops or the purpose-built elevated sections of the city.

“Just a few more steps, we’re almost there!” The armorer shouted back with a reassuring huff.

After a few more minutes of non-stop descent, I was eventually led out from the staircase and onto an elevated scaffolding that was raised twenty or so feet above an expansive room. A room that just seemed to go on forever in every possible direction.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 1000% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

And one that was practically *bathed* in mana-radiation from so many distinct sources that the HUD found it easier to collate it all into a neat stack of notifications.

Though after a quick glance at everything, it soon became clear just *what* these sources were.

Within the cavernous space were rows upon rows of what I could only describe as micro-forges, each generating an incredible amount of light and heat that was compounded by how closely packed all of them were. Little self-contained work benches were spread amongst them, and what appeared to be a series of minecarts further connected each of these workstations together.

Each station seemed to be focused on the forging of a particular aspect of a weapon. I could see parts of blades, pommels, handguards, and various other pieces of an endless variety of pre-gunpowder era weaponry being crafted by hand. Or rather, by armored hands. As each and every station was manned by what I could only describe was *miniature*, simplified versions of the armorer.

The weapons being forged seemed to follow this trend of simplification as well. As the bits and pieces of weaponry weren’t anywhere nearly as intricate as the ones above. There were no written inscriptions, no fancy engravings, not even the gold trimmings or finishings that I’d expected from a magical weapon. Instead, they seemed to be rather plain and simple. Well crafted, sure, but still plain.

Everything here was forged and crafted by hand, then sent along a predetermined path via autonomous carts, pushed along through means unknown, towards what I could only describe as *assembly* benches. Where beings of armor about the same size as the armorer himself, but lacking in the detailing department, assembled each piece together before loading them up and sending them off further down the line.

It didn’t take long for me to realize what all this was.

The ramifications of this were just starting to sink in as I felt the man’s hollow glove landing on my shoulder with a dull *thunk*.

“This is-”

“This is a *manufactorium*, Emma Booker.” The man spoke with glee. “For you see, each handsome golem you see there? Well, they’re *parts* of me. Or more specifically, they’re *fragments*. Aspects of my memory and experiences that have been extracted and imbued with a single task in mind, and a single role to perform, with *just enough* of the knowledge required to do so.” The man began, as he leaned against one of the few pieces of railing that existed on this elevated platform. “You see, Emma Booker, any realm can birth legendary blacksmiths. Such as yours, clearly, as who else could have been responsible for the immaculate craftsmanship of the armor I see before me? The problem, however, lies in what happens when that skill inevitably meets its untimely demise, and-, well I’m getting a bit ahead of myself here.” The man hastily corrected himself, diverting the trajectory of the conversation. This marked perhaps one of the first few instances of discretion I’d seen from the man so far. “The problem *also* lies in what happens if you need *more* than what a lone smith can produce, as the inherent limitations of manpower starts to limit the potential of any fledgling civilization desiring greatness.”

I could hear a slyness beginning to form in the man’s voice, as it was clear that if he still had a face, he’d be grinning with pride right about now. “This is what we smiths, artificers, forgers, and enchanters have dedicated our lives to solving, and it is with our collective efforts that we’ve managed to go beyond merely *solving* this little predicament. For we now live in an era where the gifts and skills, the talents and experiences, the *magical potential* of an individual is no longer *bound* to that one person. Why, it would be a *shame* for someone like myself to be relegated to producing ten swords a day would it not? That rate of smithing wouldn’t be remotely enough to arm a squad of outer guardsman.” He made a point of putting a hand to where his mouth should have been in an exaggerated display of faux-indignity. “This is where *manufactoriums* come in. It allows for the mass proliferation of the magical gifts, the learned skills, and the time-tested experiences of a single master weaponsmith, to be disseminated amongst *hundreds of thousands* of hands. It allows for a contemporary civilization to even *exist* in the first place. It takes the small pool of those talented and gifted, and expands on them tens, hundreds, thousands, hundreds of thousands, or even millions of times over! This does, of course, heavily depend on the skills, systems, and spells in place. Though the goal is ultimately the same: to multiply the reach of magic, by allowing the proliferation of artifices on a grand scale.” The armorer’s voice grew louder and louder throughout his boisterous speech, causing the platform to quite literally shake as a part of his show of theatrics. Even after it was all over, I could hear parts of the speech still echoing throughout the seemingly endless cavern.

At the end of it all, I was stunned.

Not because of the scale of industry before me of course.

But because of the fact that the Nexus was even capable of *any* industry, or even the concept of mass production to begin with.

This changes things.

And brings into question what I’d been able to discern from the likes of Thacea and Thalmin thus far.

As *all of this* stood in stark contrast to the advancement and scale of society the pair seemed to be hinting at throughout all of our interactions.

“Sorecar, forgive me if I’m confused or something here, but aside from my own realm, don’t all other adjacent realms have mana and thus magic?”

“That is correct, Emma Booker!” The man beamed back.

“Then I need you to clarify something for me. Earlier today, one of my peers had mentioned something about the Nexian Outer Guard. The specifics of the conversation currently elude me, but I digress.” *Okay Emma, calm down, you’re starting to scare me with the flowery language here. SIOP says you’re supposed to* ***match*** *the local dialect, not* ***compete*** *in it*. A part of me thought to myself. “The way they spoke of the Outer Guard gave off the implication that their own realms were somehow unable to field armies to a similar standard. If all adjacent realms have magic, then surely the extent of how well-equipped the Outer Guard is shouldn’t be surprising to them, correct?” I asked. A part of me wanted to be upfront about it, as all I wanted to do was to ask *why* Thacea and Thalmin had been stumped by the concept of mass production if there was already a magical equivalent. Though phrasing it like that would mean I’d be giving away hints of Earth’s capabilities before I was ready to divulge it.

“Hah! They’re *adjacent realmers* like yourself, Emma Booker.” The man answered without a hint of hesitation. “Adjacent realmers, even ones that have been partnered to the Nexus for tens of thousands of years, still lack the capacity to do what we do here in the Nexus. With all that being said, it isn’t surprising why your newfound peers hold our Outer Guardsman in such high regards, since no equivalent exists beyond the Nexus.”

*Since no equivalent exists beyond the Nexus…*

All of this began making so much sense.

The concentration of production, the accumulation and buildup of manufacturing capabilities, *all of it* through a bastardized version of conventional industrialization… if the Nexus really was the only one capable of this, then it was obvious why they’d managed to come out on top.

And this wasn’t even accounting for whatever magical ace-in-the-hole they had in the form of their *actual* magic-users.

However, despite its impressiveness, all of this did raise another question. Why didn’t the other adjacent realms just copy-

“I apologize if I’ve been too headstrong and overly enthusiastic about this entire state of affairs, Emma Booker.” The man quickly added, pulling me out of my next train of thought. “I’d just assumed that since you seemed enthusiastic to learn more about the true underpinnings of our advanced magical society, that you’d be alright with my tirades. Which, admittedly, can come across as a tad bit too intensive in some regards.” The man offered.

The over apologeticness was a welcome break from what could’ve quickly devolved into another Ilunor-like spat. If the lizard were here, or heck, if any other member of the faculty was here to give me the tour, I assumed that we’d be neck deep in an intense monologue or speech about how vastly superior the Nexus was and how Earthrealm was probably just a bunch of thatched huts next to a river or something. The fact that the armorer was at least self-aware of how condescending these speeches could go was a breath of fresh air.

“It’s alright, Sorecar.” I managed out. “It’s just a lot to take in, is all.” I spoke, omitting a lot in the process, including my rampant desires to make flat-out comparisons of this manufactorium to Earth and the Ind-Net.

“I can imagine it must be quite overwhelming, in which case, I’m thankful that your first exposure to a *manufactorium* was here at the Academy and not some place else within the Nexus.” He candidly remarked.

Which sparked an entirely new line of questioning in my head.

“So this sort of thing isn’t uncommon in the Nexus?” I continued asking, digging into the specifics now. “Just how commonplace are manufactoriums?”

Something that the EVI was probably eager to listen in on.

“Ah, hah. That’s… Apologies, Emma Booker. Tackling that question is indeed a tricky one. I do not know the specifics myself, as I only know of *known-manufactoriums*, not *crown-manufactoriums*. In addition, I…” The man paused, making this the second time he’d purposefully halted himself mid-speech. Which, given his track record so far, could only mean one of two things. Either he realized what he was about to get into warranted some level of discretion, or he was getting into territory that hit him hard emotionally.

“I… can’t say for certain.” He finally managed to utter out with a despondent sigh. “And no, this isn’t a matter of discretion or anything of the sort. I just genuinely lack the knowledge necessary to tell you.” Earnest as it was, it seemed like that was the extent of his reasoning. He looked away from me, that enthusiasm in his movements now mellowed out as he stopped to stare into the fiery greater forge in this room. “You see, when I said I was bound to the Academy, I truly did mean it in every capacity of the word. For not only am I physically restricted to the grounds within its walls, but so too am I unable to socially project myself beyond my narrow sliver of relevance and utility.”Sorecar flexed his fingers in one hand, before raising his shoulder pads in a laid-back shrug. “Thus, correspondences to the world beyond the Academy are few and far in between. The only exceptions to this rule are the various Weapons Fairs of the Nexus, but even *that* has its limitations. For the Academy sends not myself, but a *representative* on my behalf alongside weapons of *my* design. As a result, this small window into the world is made even smaller as all I hear back are cherry-picked details. Rarely do I hear anything pertaining to the trade, let alone any solid numbers to speak of.” He took another deep breath, placing a single hand to his helmet’s visor, mimicking how someone might pinch the bridge of their nose in deep thought. “Though, as a rough estimate, the last Weapons Festival had a total of ten thousand applicants, in which only one thousand were chosen for candidacy for the Crowns’ Fair. Which would imply that there’s *at least* ten thousand currently in existence.” The man ended his lengthy tirade with the same despondent sigh he’d started it with.

A sigh which just didn’t sit right with me, as my concern began to grow.

And it wasn’t because of the number of factories, even with the low-ball estimate of ten-thousand.

Those were rookie numbers, and it made the Nexus’ manufacturing output to be something more comparable to pre-intrasolar Earth.

No, what bothered me was the sheer unfairness of it all. Of a person having to deal with five thousand whole years of living in the shadow of his work, without once being able to actually *enjoy* the best part of it.

Seeing it in action with a crowd cheering on.

With all of that being said, an idea quickly began manifesting in the back of my gremlin mind.

An idea that, while kind of dumb, was at least worth trying. Or at the very least, being put to writing.

A field trip was now on the table.

“EVI.”

**“Yes, Cadet Booker?”**

“Add a new questline: Find a way to get Sorecar to this year’s, or next year’s, or whichever year’s Weapons Fair.”

**“Error: Unknown Request. Clarify, what do you mean by** ***add new questline***\*\*?”\*\* The AI shot back with an *attitude*.

“Just, make it a memo. A memo with an *indefinite* time limit. God knows I already have enough on my fucking plate as it is.”

**“Acknowledged. Memo added. Would you like to set priority?”**

“Not yet, but remind me like sometime after we get the crate back or someone blows up.”

**“Acknowledged, Cadet Booker.”**

The fact that the idea was actually now saved somewhere in the back of the EVI’s dataspace satisfied me for now.

However, it was clear Sorecar was once again starting to worry, if his twiddling fingers were any indication.

My brief bouts of silence probably weren’t doing this whole *newrealmer is in complete shock at the Nexus’ capabilities* stereotype any favors.

Though to be fair… perhaps that was a good thing? It *did* help with my aims of keeping any hints  of humanity’s capabilities under wraps as best as possible.

“Emma Booker, are you-”

“I’m fine, Sorecar, sorry. I was lost in thought. All of this is just so incredibly… surprising.” I acknowledged, diving into the lie of omission territory yet again.

“That’s quite alright, take all the time you need, Emma Booker.” The man reassured me, speaking in a tone that actually felt heartfelt and genuine, a far cry from most of my interactions with the faculty so far.

“Thanks Sorecar.” I returned politely, before getting back into the intel-gathering driver’s seat. “But there is something else that’s starting to bother me.”

“And what is that?” The man responded with a simple head-tilt.

Now was time for the trillion dollar question. One that’d help me hit my threat assessment report right out of the park.

“You mentioned how there’s at least ten thousand manufactoriums out there, so that got me thinking… Why do you need so many?” I asked without hesitation.

To which the armorer, yet again, replied without missing a single beat.

“It’s not just about arming more soldiers, or simply expanding the guard, Emma Booker.” He began, before drifting into yet another tangent. “Though I admit, the scale of smithing and production *is* necessary, as the outer guardsman of a single Nexian Duchy typically numbers somewhere in the hundreds of thousands.” Before once again, getting back on topic. “But beyond that, more than that really, it’s about maintenance.” The man concluded simply, before vaguely gesturing at an entire section of the factory. “More than half of the manufactorium is dedicated to repair and re-enchantment work. The fact of the matter is, since these weapons are being given to those with a mana-field but lacking in the ability to manipulate mana, the weapons instead need to rely on either their own source of mana or the surrounding environmental mana to sustain their magic. In the case of the former, they’re equipped with mana-ducts, which allows for the weapon to draw directly from a portable mana ampoule. Whilst in the case of the latter, the weapon instead draws from the surrounding mana to power its spells. Regardless of which method is used, both cause severe strain on the weapon. This strain can be as mild as an atrophy of the core, causing the weapon to become permanently inert. Or it can be as severe as a mana-channeling dysfunction, causing the weapon to fail catastrophically. As a result of this, most manufactoriums are dedicated to around-the-clock maintenance work. It’s the unglamorous side of the magic-fueled world we live in. And it’s one often overlooked by the elites of the adjacent realms as they chase after flashy spells, and not long-term investments such as these.”

To say that answer was nothing short of enlightening would’ve been an understatement.

My whole metaphor of this being industrialized magic really *was* more accurate than I had initially thought.

Whilst this was a lot to take in, it probably didn’t even come close to what it would’ve felt like being introduced to all of this as a typical newrealmer. *Especially* if they’d arrived fresh from a medieval world with a lesser advanced state of magic.

Being introduced to a magical equivalent of a ye olde factory as a human just didn't have that same effect. However, it didn’t *need* to, for me to be on my toes.

The fact that the factory even existed in the first place threw off my general assumptions about the Nexus. With that one assumption thrown off, everything else was fair game, who knows what other ‘fantasy conventions’ would be thrown out the window?

I couldn’t just dismiss the Nexus’ defense credibility just yet, especially as my mission involved assessing any and all potential threats on this side of the portal with extreme scrutiny.

For as much as I was learning about the Nexus right now, this was only a small, tiny glimpse into what was so clearly a much bigger picture.

Which led me to my next point, one that tied back to an earlier topic that’d been derailed earlier by the armorer.

“You say that these sorts of investments are often overlooked by the nobles attending the Academy.” I began, jumping straight off of the armorer’s throwaway statements. “And you also stated earlier that the Adjacent Realms lack the capacity to do what you do here in the Nexus, at least in terms of manufacturing and production.” I carefully prodded, before pinning both of my arms to my side with a slight cock of my head. “I just find it hard to believe that’s possible.”

“Excuse me?” Sorecar reared his whole body back, clearly not anticipating this sort of rebuttal after what felt like a flurry of non stop lecturing.

“It’s been thousands of years, surely the knowledge of these manufactoriums have spread to at least *someone* in one of the Adjacent Realms?”

“Well, yes, I do not dispute that. A select few of course, but, I digress. I’ve actually conducted this tour a few times before the war.” The man paused, as if realizing where I was going with this, as he started changing his tune. “Though the possession of knowledge, does not directly translate to its replication somewhere else.”

“Over the course of a lifetime? Perhaps not, but if the *idea* is there, then wouldn’t the code be cracked with enough time? I mean, I’d assume some adjacent realms have been connected to the Nexus for tens of thousands of years now, correct?” I shot back.

“Correct, and if this were *any* other matter, say the creation of an nth level golem, or certain planar-level spells, then you would most certainly be in the right, Emma Booker. However… this issue goes *beyond* a mere deficit in knowledge, willpower, time, or even political capital. This is a matter which relates to the very fundamental nature of the adjacent realms themselves.” The man spoke emphatically, gesticulating less wildly than before, making it clear that at some point he would’ve made for a pretty good lecturer. “You see, the Adjacent Realms cannot replicate a manufactorium, because they lack the richness of mana that is present in the Nexus. So even *if* they do manage to find a means of safe memory-infusion, and even *if* they had all of my trade secrets, the scarcity of mana simply wouldn’t allow for the *fragments* below us to exist in the first place. Not to mention the mana required for everything else you *don’t* see happening within the manufactorium’s walls.”

I needed a moment to process that, as I went silent for a few solid seconds.

*So the issue wasn’t just scale, nor was it a pure lack of knowledge. Those could be overcome with time.*

*No, the issue here ran deeper than that.*

*It was the nature of the adjacent realms themselves.*

Which more or less fit what Belnor had mentioned during orientation, that the whole five day grace period thing was a mandatory break in order for the bodies of adjacent realmers to adapt to the richer air of mana in the Nexus.

Come to think of it, even the Apprentice made note of this during her whole attempt to cover up the sudden burst of mana radiation during breakfast. As she mentioned how such things were possible given how much richer the Nexus was in mana.

“So it’s an outright physical impossibility.” I mumbled out, as I regarded my next question carefully.

There was just one more thing that bugged me. One more aspect of this whole trip that I wanted to address now.

“Sorecar.”

“Yes Emma Booker?”

“You mentioned how the last tour you did of this place was sometime *before the war*. So I have to ask: am I even allowed in here?”

“In the case of the typical newrealmer? I’d have to file a proper request to the dean or the vice dean.”

“So, you’re breaking the rules a bit by allowing me to be here?”

“Simply put, yes, Emma Booker.”

I paused at that, realizing that given the context of the draconian society that was the Academy, that this was a much bigger deal than it probably would be back on Earth.

“Why?” I managed out.

“It’s really quite simple, Emma Booker. For one, I merely wish to reciprocate your enthusiasm for learning. Rarely do I have an opportunity to educate others in my field of expertise. So I’m taking it upon myself to… *bend* the rules and decorum somewhat.” The man nodded a few times to emphasize this point, his tonal shift reflecting his genuine desire just for a conversation. “And two? Anything I say here will be of absolutely no use for you in your realm. As all of this.” He gestured once more to the factory. “Is impossible to accomplish without mana. In short, I do not need approval from the faculty, as I find there to be no risk in bringing up and discussing any of these topics. As without *any* mana to speak of, replicating the very concept of a manufactorium, and the subsequent scale of its production, is simply an impossibility.”

*I would be lying if I didn’t say I wasn’t feeling the unrepentant urge to take Sorecar, stuff him in one of my crates, and bring him back with me for the summer holidays.*

*If only he could get a sneak peek into the megafoundries in EarthRing, or the megaforges of the belt, or perhaps even the Jovian Stellar Foundries.*

If only he knew the truth.

"or until someone blows up"

Is someone going to get blown up for some reason and EVI will remind Emma of her mini-quest then and there? Cause that would be hilarious.

This is kinda depressing man, Sorecar has so little knowledge of even his own realm due tio how much info the Nexus controls for Adjacent Realms and their inhabitants(which extends to anyone they seem fit it seems). Sorecar would probably have his metal jaw drop if he saw what Earth was capable of, I feel the same as Emma and I wanna make him go on vacation and go around to forged/factories and such on this future Earth. I so wanna see his reactions to Future Earth's technology, but that would probably be against mission code for Emma.

Great chapter as usual! Thank you for making such stellar works like this and Human's Don't Hibernate! Currently catching up on HDH as I'm like 5 behind due to being a bit lazy hahaha.

What Nexus has is *early* industrialization.  Beyond cottage level, but far less than an Earth factory.  It is dependent upon the skills of a single individual.  Should that individual die, the industry stops.

An Earth factory, even if the mind that dreamed it up dies, can and will continue producing.  That mind can go and produce more factories.

Even more important, other minds can look at what was done and improve it.  Collaboration leads to efficiency and improvements in the process as well as the product.

Now consider the outer realms.

They are ripe for rebellion.  They lack only the weapons production to power the rebellion.

And here is Earth, with the answer to their problems.  A technology that works in a magic field but does not require immense stores of magic energy to function.

Moreover, Earth has obviously learned to direct the flow of magic, otherwise, they could not create the bubble that our hero sleeps in.

If they could contain magic as well, they can create magic batteries.

And, if as I suspect, magic is simply another form of energy, I would not be surprised if they can convert from... say... electricity to magic and vice versa.

Imagine a steam turbine power station creating magical energy wherever it is needed, like in an outer realm manufactory.

*THUD!*

**“Extraction point reached. Equipment Status Report (ESR): High-Performance Maneuverability Gear (HPMG) - Nominal, Active Camouflage - Nominal. Requesting operator status.”**

I let out a series of heavy, breathy pants, fighting my stomach’s desire to appease the vertigo gods by chucking up my less than impressive breakfast consisting of a single bite of crispy bread and a tube of nutripaste. My whole body had all but given out, and I *would* have crumpled into a sorry heap of sweaty human if it wasn’t for the EVI activating the suit’s *in-armor positional reorientation* mode, keeping the armor nice and rigid whilst I squirmed inside.

To the outside observer, and most notably to Thalmin, I would’ve arrived with the flair of your typical videogame protagonist. Having gracefully, and rather epically might I add, landed on both armored feet whilst simultaneously decloaking *and* retracting both the grappler and its tether. I even did the thing they taught you in training where you *followed-through* when the grappler was fully retracted, meaning I’d pulled both of my arms back just as the grappler housing unit *clanked* shut; resulting in me inadvertently striking a pose just to cement my triumphant return.

Tween and teen Emma would’ve *loved* seeing this, and would’ve given anything and everything to be present-Emma.

Present-Emma, however, wanted nothing more than to die right now.

**“Elevated Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, and Respiratory Rate detected. Cadet Booker, do you require medical assistance?”**

“No, I’m fine.” I managed out through a stifled hiccup.

**“Affirmative.”** The EVI replied mechanically. Then as if nothing happened, it repeated the query from before in the exact same tone and cadence. **“Requesting operator status.”**

I groaned out in annoyance at that. But what was I expecting from a *military* VI? Some fake commercial-grade faux-compassion protocols?

“Operator status: nothing to report, just some mild nausea and vertigo.”

**“Affirmative. Do you wish for me to administer anti-nausea medication, Cadet Booker?”**

“No, I’m fine.”

**“Affirmative. Terminating Battlefield Networking and Combat Maneuverability Assistance Runtimes, standby.”**

Just like that, I found half of my HUD suddenly freed up. The various programs and subroutines that were practically carrying me through that whole sidequest were suddenly terminated, their processing power being reallocated to the EVI as the virtual intelligence took back all of its real-estate with a ravenous hunger.

“Emma.” I heard the voice of a certain wolf prince breaking through my reverie. “That was… just…” I could hear him leading up to a compliment, a gushing one at that if that wagging tail was any indicator, but he stopped halfway. Instead, he decided to step forward, only to punch one of my shoulderguards with his fist. “Ya didn’t need to show off you know!” He spoke through a toothy grin. “There’s nothing to prove and no one to prove it to, so calm down with the theatrics there, my would-be rogue!” He continued, giving out a series of hefty, hearty chuckles as he did so. “You’re performing to an audience of one!”

I snickered outwardly, before responding with a healthy shrug and an unseen smirk. “Where I come from, flashiness and practicality aren’t mutually exclusive. But thanks for the considerate words, I’m glad to know I have a future as an entertainer or a rogue if things between the UN and the Nexus turn sour, or should my stint at the UN not pan out.”

The lupinor let out a single dry chuckle at that, baring his fangs as he did so. “It’s good to have an exit strategy, should things indeed take a turn. Which reminds me, how did things go with the Apprentice?” The lupinor’s tone took a shift at this, as he transitioned from that playful banter into a more serious tone of voice. “Did our gambit work out?”

“I would probably be fulfilling my surname’s namesake and be *booking* it out of here if things had gone south, Thalmin.” I began with a bout of sly humor.

Thalmin’s expressions however, didn’t seem to reciprocate my attempt at a joke.

I took this prompting to correct my course, as I purposefully cleared my throat before continuing. “In all seriousness, Thalmin, things went surprisingly well. The apprentice didn’t freak out. In fact, she seemed quite receptive. More receptive than I honestly expected, but I think a lot of it has to do with what she calls a *life-debt*? I’m not sure if that’s a literal thing here in the Nexus, but given how serious she seems to be taking it, I bet it had a pretty significant impact on how she took my request; especially when you consider the *unconventional* way I went about getting to her in the first place.”

“A *life-debt*?” Thalmin parroted back with a severe look on his face, his snout actually wrinkling as he said that. “Did she actually use those words, Emma?”

“Yeah.”

“The apprentice…” The lupinor paused, trailing off as he seemed to be trying to find the right words. “...Is proving to be more honorable of a soul than I initially gave her credit for. Life-debts aren’t something to be trifled with, Emma. They are as socially binding as they are honor-binding. So this is rather significant progress. Please, continue.”

“There’s nothing much more than that to our conversation to be honest. We talked about the crate, I emphasized how big of a threat it posed, and she agreed to help. She said she’ll be talking to Mal’tory ASAP, probably sometime tonight.” I shrugged, before I realized a pretty sizable revelation that I’d all but left out. “There *was* a pretty non-insignificant development that I wasn’t really expecting from the whole exchange though.” I muttered out under a half breath, eliciting quite a few visible twitches from the lupinor’s triangular ears. I took this as my cue to keep on going. “You remember how it was pretty obvious that they were singling out that crate specifically, right? From the videologs we reviewed a few days ago?”

“Yeah, I do. I’m assuming she told you more about what it was that triggered that response?”

“Correct, and it wasn’t what I was expecting, like, at all. The apprentice claims, and I quote: that *Professor Mal’tory wished to reclaim what is rightfully the property of the Academy, and by extension, the property of the Crown*.”

Thalmin’s features began shifting yet again at that revelation, a dour severity took over, as the lupinor’s eyes began to dilate with a look of genuine unease.

“Emma…” He began with a throaty breath. “What *exactly* did your people put inside of that box?”

“Well, the apprentice called it a *Minor Shard of Impart*. She said-”

“Stop. Did you just say a *Minor Shard of Impart*?!” Thalmin interjected with a solid, guttural bark.

“Yeah I did. So after that she said-”

“WHY DID YOUR PEOPLE FEEL THE NEED TO PUT A PLANAR-LEVEL GIFTED ARTIFACT INTO YOUR PERSONAL BELONGINGS?!” The lupinor prince shot back with a series of loud, ear-shattering barks, each one louder than the next, which for a split second managed to surprise and overwhelm the EVI’s automatic volume adjustments.

“I have an answer for that.” I managed out with a sheepish tone. “I really do, but you gotta give me a sec.”

“DON’T THINK YOU CAN JUST GRAPPLE AWAY FROM YOUR PROBLEMS EMMA-”

“No, no. I’m not going anywhere. I just need to check something real quick, alright?”

With a look of utter confusion from Thalmin, I switched off my external mic, turning to the EVI as I addressed it with little room for patience. “So, schematics of the ECS? What did’ya find there, EVI?”

**“The** ***Minor Shard of Impart*** **corresponds to a component designated as the AM-d-002b Low-Bandwidth Exoreality Unidirectional Narrowband Pulsator \[AM-d-002 L-BEUNP\], colloquially known within the exo-com department as the Trans-Dimensional Tranceiver.”**

“That doesn’t sound really Nexian to me-”

**“AM-d-002b being short for Anomalous Material-derived object, Cadet Booker.”** The EVI quickly interjected, providing me with a neat little correction that could’ve just been stated outright.

“Wait, 02? I’m assuming this was the second crystal of its kind to be sent to the IAS? The one they kept talking about in D-Wing?”

**“Correct, Cadet Booker.”**

“I thought they said the thing’s power-source went kapoot ages ago? How did they-”

**Warning: 10 successive attempts at physical confrontation detected.**

“Emma?” Thalmin’s voice over-rid the conversation happening inside of the suit, his hands were currently placed on either side of my shoulders as he was shaking me, or at least attempting to, for good measure. “Emma are you alright?”

“Yeah! Yeah. I’m fine.”

“You completely froze for a solid minute there. I was getting worried.” Thalmin paused, his expressions shifting from concern to a patiently questioning one. “So, you’re sure you’re alright?”

“Yeah! I just needed some time to find an answer.”

“Alright, good. So, you’ve found an answer then?”

“Yup!”

“Alright then… WHY?!”

I let out a nervous sigh, uncertain of what it was the big brained whitecoats at home had gotten me into. “Erm, because some of our scientists and engineers were trying to construct a device that allows for communication between different realities. Now, I wasn’t exactly *briefed* on the specifics since I had a lot of other things to worry about during training. But long story short, we… kind of just retrofitted the magic crystal to send what we want it to send, instead of what it was *intended* to send.”

Thalmin’s eyes looked like they were about to pop right out of his head, as I could practically feel him *fuming* through all the layers of metal, composites, and nanoweave. “You… you actively, knowingly, and willingly repurposed a *Nexian Gift*?!”

“I mean, the apprentice said she also detected that it had been *modified* in a sense, so would that fit the bill for repurposing or-”

“YOU ACTUALLY DESECRATED A NEXIAN GIFT?!”

“Hold on just one sec.” I said sheepishly yet again, as I went through the motions of pinging the EVI for more details. “EVI, anything to say about the whole *modification* and *desecration* thing?”

**“The component in question was designated as an Anomalous Material-derived object, Cadet Booker. The designation of 002 categorizes this as the second of the Nexian objects sent through the portal to the IAS. The sub-designation of b categorizes this object as having been deconstructed into two discrete components, namely: AM-d-002**___a___**, and, AM-d-002**___b_.”__

“So that’s what they were talking about when they said they had an easy-solution to the issue of entanglement, they literally just decided to break the damn thing in half. That’s… I can’t even be fucking mad to be honest with you.” I began laughing, half because of the stress, and half because of the ridiculousness of it all. “That’s fucking brilliant.”

I finally turned back to Thalmin, who seemed to still be a bit wary at my sudden introspective escapades, but was willing to go along with it.

“We erm…” I instinctively reached my arm behind my back, in an attempt to scratch the back of my neck, but was once again met with the unyielding presence of the armor being in the way. “I mean, if your definition of desecration involves stuff like breaking the crystal in half then I guess we might have done it?”

Thalmin’s mouth hung agape at that answer, as not a single sound escaped his gaping maw.

“I know it sounds insane, but it was necessary in order to-”

“Emma…” Thalmin stopped me in my tracks by what could only be described as a cross between a dulcet growl and a concerned whimper. “Do your people have a *death wish*?!”

“I mean, it’s a *gift*, and they even said it as such. We even reiterated it. It was a gift that had a practical and utilitarian purpose: to act as a tool to facilitate communication between realities. Besides, they’re designed to go kapoot after a while right? So what’s the harm of just repurposing one that’s already dead?”

“It’s because you weren’t *supposed* to. Its purpose is to serve as a tool for communication, yes, but after its utility has gone, what instead remains is its symbolic significance . I… I think Thacea will be better at coming up with a concise explanation of this. What I do know is that these gifts are meant to be cherished, as a sign of mutual respect. What gave your people the impression that this was even a good idea to begin with?”

“The *portal people*, as we knew them at the time, emphasized that they wanted us to keep exploring all avenues to reach them. They were also incredibly vague about what they expected from us. Now, we didn’t really have a lot of options, so I think our guys kind of assumed that the crystals might have been part of that whole process to reach the other side. So, we just went at it.” I shrugged. “The natural evolution of this is the repurposing of that project for our home-grown exo-com project.”

“The… they… the… the *portal people*…” Thalmin began breathing in and out rapidly, before he started to cackle, his whole chest heaving up and down in a series of uncontrolled laughs. “The *portal people*, upon first lines of discourse, encourage new realms to further expand on their mana-based practices. When they said you were supposed to explore every possibility to reach them, they meant everything *but* the desecration of a planar-level artifact intended as a gift.” The lupinor paused, taking a moment to regain his footing as he leaned against one of the terrace’s many ornate statues. “I don’t know whether to be **terrified** for your people for having committed this brazen act of defiance, or completely **ECSTATIC** by this flagrant disregard for adjacent realm stately decorum.” His eyes pierced straight through those two lenses and right into my soul. “Can you just answer me one thing, Emma?”

“Go for it.”

“Why did your realm assume that it would be a good idea to try using a Minor Shard of Impart for your own machinations?”

I tried to come up with an answer, I really did, but only one thing came to mind. An answer that was sort of a non-answer, but was a good one all the same. “It’s because we’ve had a *long* history of tricking much smaller rocks into thinking. I think our scientists just assumed that tricking a much bigger, fancier, magic rock into *talking* for us wouldn’t be that big a leap from that time-honored tradition.”

My answer seemed to have hit harder than expected, as the lupinor mercenary prince’s face looked as if he’d just logged out of this conversation. I was left there with a completely broken prince, on a completely empty terrace with the winds starting to pick right up. Looking up, I saw rainclouds starting to form, as it was clear any open-air spaces were probably going to be soaked pretty soon.

“Come on, let’s head on inside. Thacea’s about due to come back right?”

=====

**The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts, Hallway Connecting the Castle to the Medical Wing. Local Time: 1725 Hours.**

It had been three full hours since Thacea had entered the medical wing to conduct her misdirection mission. Three full hours of what I could only imagine was an endless onslaught of vapid conversation points that would’ve all but fried my brain into a goopy mess of oobleck. I’d expected our bird princess to return with a dead look in her eyes, or worse, as a completely reprogrammed zombie having been subsumed back into the Nexian ways.

Reality however, couldn’t be further from the truth. As Thacea arrived with the same determined gaze she’d given us when she left. In fact, there wasn’t even an ounce of fatigue behind those sharp copper eyes.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 275% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

She even managed to pull up the privacy screen without breaking a sweat. Though to be fair, I wasn’t really sure how difficult those were to get set up.

“This is most certainly a welcome surprise.” Thacea began, slowly but surely shedding that haughty ‘proper’ cadence, and entering into that earnest tone of voice that honestly felt more at home with the person she was. “I’m glad to see both of you are well.” The avinor took a moment to pause as she noted Thalmin’s expressions. This seemed to be enough for Thacea to gather that something *else* had recently developed.

“Emma, could you please tell me what exactly happened with the apprentice?” The princess spoke with a preemptively timed exasperated sigh.

=====

**Dragon’s Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30. Living Room. Local Time: 1755 Hours.**

It was probably a good thing that Thalmin was the first person I talked to about the true nature of the ECS, because it was clear that Thacea had *a lot* more to say, but was keeping her side of things deathly silent until we finally returned to the dorm. It was clear she was using the commute time for all it was worth, as those eyes never once let up in their intensity throughout the entirety of our walk back.

It was only after the doors to the dorm had closed did she finally relent, letting out a sigh as she turned towards me, then Thalmin, before gesturing for the both of us to take our respective seats on the living room couch. “And that’s all you’ve told her about the significance of the Shard of Impart?” Thacea kicked things off by directly addressing Thalmin.

“Yes. I mean, you must forgive me princess, I wasn’t one to regularly frequent the Havenbrockian Ministry of Adjacency. It was more my sister’s prerogative, as I was training for the ranks of the military, before finally being singled out for the Academy.” The lupinor prince shrugged.

“That’s quite alright.” Thacea managed out politely. “I’ll take things from here.” The princess now turned towards me, as those avian eyes once more pierced straight through my opaque lenses. “Emma, what your realm has done is something that few would ever *think* to do, much less *dare to act upon*. Stately Decorum deems gifts as less of a transference of ownership, but rather, a transference of ownership with *caveats*. Namely, that the item in question be undefiled, and is to be in the same condition it was received. It is a matter of courtesy, and a test of due diligence. The *modification* of a *gift* not only violates Stately Decorum, but it also is a taboo that hearkens back to The Great War. Beyond this, the very nature of it being one of the scant few magical artifacts capable of planar-level magic, is yet another strike against your favor in the eyes of the Nexus.” Thacea laid it all out for me, as it was clear she wasn’t done with *just* that topical explanation. I honestly expected nothing less from her. “The Minor Shard of Impart is one of the fundamental cornerstones which underpins the Status Communicatia, the forum of inter-realm diplomacy that ties all realms to the Nexus. During the war, these shards were purposefully shattered, as a sign of rebellion against the Nexus. Legends say that its shattered remains were repurposed into a *new* system of Status Communicatia, one that doesn’t rely on the Nexus as its focal point. Though many question whether or not this venture was successful, the act of destroying a Minor Shard of Impart has become synonymous with open discontent, or outright rebellion. Now, since Earthrealm is still considered a newrealm, I’m certain this offense will not be considered in the same light. I believe what Professor Mal’tory is truly concerned about is what you claim to be… a means of repurposing the Shard of Impart for your own purposes.”

The princess paused, as the wave of just… *everything* was already starting to hit me *hard*. Everything made so much more sense now that she put things into perspective, and provided me with that crucial historical precedence that changed everything.

“Emma, you do realize that if your artifice works, it would be analogous to the legendary counter to the Status Communicatia. It would be proving a principle that has all but been shrouded by the sands of time.  I believe this is why Professor Mal’tory has taken possession of your artifice, Emma. It’s not just for the purposes of saving face from the embarrassment you inflicted on him during orientation. It’s also not simply because it’s an offense against the Stately Decorum. I believe that one of the major instigating factors is in fact the destruction, modification, and repurposing of your realm’s Minor Shard of Impart.” Thacea stated concisely, causing both Thalmin and myself to turn towards each other with a look of outright disbelief.

“I… fuck this is becoming way more intense than I thought.” I paused, before leaning in closer. “How do you know so much about this whole thing, anyways Thacea?”

“Knowledge has always been one of the few weapons in my arsenal to ward off against the others within my court that would prefer I was no longer a nuisance and a blight on the realm. Rather than pursuing potential mates, sharpening my talons or my blade, or honing in my web of connections, I instead focus also on the accumulation of every scrap of knowledge I can muster. You will be surprised how certain esoteric bits of knowledge can be used to one’s advantage against many a royal and noble.” Thacea spoke in coldly, and in no uncertain terms, before turning to face Thalmin. “No offense was made to *your* endeavors of  sharpening your claw and blade of course, Thalmin. I was merely providing my side of the story.”

“No offense taken princess, you know how things are in Havenbrockrealm. It’s far less… *intense*, and far more casual than the court life in Aetheronrealm.”

I took a few moments just to *breathe* after that entire spiel, as Thacea and Thalmin’s gazes now landed on me. “So, I do have a few questions about this Minor Shard of Impart business.”

“Go on, Emma?” Thacea chirped affirmatively.

“Why can’t your realms just make their own?” I asked bluntly, as a part of my memory quickly harkened back to that conversation with Sorecar. Maybe this was the result of the same issue?

“Two primary reasons. One: lack of expertise. Two: a lack of significant enough levels of mana to allow for the propagation of the crystals used to make the minor shard of impart. You must understand, Emma, the minor shard of impart is a truly *planar-level* artifact. Not just an artifice, but an artifact. It isn’t so much created as it is *birthed* from the earth itself. This is the result of a combination of geology and mana that can only be found here in the Nexus. This is why the Nexus *gifts* these shards annually, as the ambient environmental mana of adjacent realms are incapable of sustaining its use. The less mana a realm has, the more shards are sent to resupply that adjacent realm, as the internal mana stores of these Shards of Impart deplete quicker the less ambient mana a realm has. Which begs the question… how are your people so certain that this artifice will even work? By what means are you assuming you can simply break a Minor Shard of Impart in half in order to communicate back to your realm?”

“Yeah, didn’t you say Earthrealm was a mana-less realm, Emma?” Thalmin quickly added.

It was at this point that I turned to the EVI, who had already conveniently pulled up a diagram of the ECS, particularly of it in-action. I went to work reading the simplified diagram, before I finally got it.

My eyes grew wide as I saw just what the white coats at home had concocted, and to say that I was beyond ecstatic at what the science boys had come up with, would be nothing short of an understatement.

“Simple, princess.” I started, as I grinned wildly underneath my helmet. “We’re just using the same rules you just outlined.”

Thacea’s face went completely blank for a moment, as something very quickly clicked in her head, leading to two eyes which shot back a look of complete and utter disbelief.

“You’re not implying that-”

“Oh yes I am.” I interjected with a snicker growing ever more prominent. “We’re in the Nexus are we not? The MREDD has already proven a simple principle, that our artifices are capable of shoving mana from one area to another, hence why my tent is mana-free. It’s not that hard to consider the possibility of pushing mana from the ambient air already rich in it, back into a small enclosed space. And you said it yourself: the crystals are only capable of growing naturally here in the Nexus due to the sheer concentration of mana here. The Exoreality Communications Suite has a dedicated series of mana extraction chambers designed expressly for the concentration of mana back into the chamber with the crystal. I’m assuming that’s enough to *make it work*, right?”

Thalmin’s face was all but *glowing* with complete and utter excitement, as he turned to Thacea as if to gauge her reactions to my small little explanation.

The avinor… was expectedly, completely floored. “As simple as that is… This actually might work.” She admitted with a breathless sigh.

“There’s something about you Earthrealmers that just keeps putting a smile on my face, Emma.” Thalmin panted back with an excitable grin, punching the side of my armor with a furred fist as I could only look back with a look of genuine giddiness. “How about we take tonight to leave for a small feast in the grand dining hall? The apprentice will be talking to Professor Mal’tory tonight won’t she? I’m certain the professor will summon you sometime in the morning. So how about we spend tonight feasting away, in preparation for what’s to come tomorrow?”

I turned my head reluctantly towards Thacea, as if waiting for her go-ahead.

“This is a prudent course of action.” Thacea nodded once. “It is important to keep appearances, public social gatherings are but an aspect of this.”

It was with this majority vote that I reluctantly agreed with a heavy sigh. “It’s not like I’ll be able to eat anything, but, sure. It’ll get my mind off of things until tomorrow morning I guess.”

=====

**5 Hours Later**

**Dragon’s Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30. Local Time: 2355 Hours.**

The dinner was just about what I’d expected from Nexus fare: fancy, overplanned, and seemingly endless. When I thought they’d just about ended dinner service, *another* platter came out as if to taunt me and my inability to consume those tasty morsels. I don’t think I’ve ever spent more than an hour at a dinner before, let alone five.

By the end of it, I felt like I’d been put through a gauntlet. Though having five hours of downtime just to talk with both Thacea and Thalmin was honestly kind of nice. It was certainly something I didn’t know I needed, but I was happy enough to have gone along with. Sort of like when your friends invite you to do something you didn’t want, but it ended up being better than you thought.

Though I would be lying if I didn’t say I was more than glad to be out of there, as we now turned the corner towards our dorm.

Except instead of an empty hallway, I was met with a lone golem, standing patiently in front of the door.

My heart suddenly sank right into my gut as I realized what this was all about.

“**Emma Booker. Professor Mal’tory has approved your request. The Professor sees fit that you meet him immediately. Please, follow me.**” The golem spoke with a guttural, bassy voice, as if the stones inside its form were vibrating in order to generate that facsimile of a voice.

I turned back to face Thacea and Thalmin, who looked on at me with genuine concern.

“It’ll be alright.” I managed back with a forced smile. “I’ll be back before you know it. Promise you won’t blow anything up while I’m gone alright?” I made one last attempt at defusing the tense scene with a small infusion of humor.

Thalmin responded with a nervous smile. Thacea took it a step further by gripping my hand tight and maintaining a steady gaze of determination, as both of our eyes locked for what felt like longer than just a few seconds. “Remember what I told you over dinner: calm is the ally of the victor, panic is the flatterer of the defeated.”

I responded with a small squeeze through my gloved hands feeling the avian’s gaze of determination flowing through me, before carefully untangling my hand from her own. “Trust me, I’ll be fine.”

“I will count that as a promise, Emma. Know that knights do not break their word.”

It was with those few parting words that I finally stepped away from the group, trailing behind the golem as my course was now set to see this whole thing through.

They find a manaless "newrelm", give them a crystal, tell them to continue to reach to them and DON'T tell them the taboo about breaking the gift?  They were presuming a society of uncivilized primitives. Wouldn't uncivilized primitives just break the magic talkey rock by default unless warned?  The Nexus really needs a better first contact protocol.

Humans instinctively doing something they aren't supposed to and making a breakthrough discovery is pretty damn accurate lol

Gotta admit though, giving a realm unfamiliar with Nexian decorum a gift and the expecting them to follow said Decorum regardless is quite a stupid move on the Nexus's part. What were they expecting exactly? I'm really curious about what Mal'tory has to say about the communicator device, will he just be mindblown like Thacea and Thalmin or will he act offended at the *travesty* of breaking the silently-implied-to-be-untouchable gift? Can't wait to find out.

Good afternoon Guardians!

Yesterday marked a substantial Sandbox update which basically changed the face of the game forever going forward. There was Buffs, Nerfs, Tweaks, Tickles and some complete overhauls in the game we've come accustomed to over the last year

Here, I want to outline the burning questions that have inevitably surfaced through this update to cover bases and to hopefully resolve issues following on such a big patch. 

Here is everything updated for info:

**I dropped the game because X Y Z, should I play again?**

#YES

Alright, that's the short answer and too personal in opinion and guides don't do that. 

I don't decide that, you do and YOU are the important one and my favourite Guardian just incase I never told you before. So get your Coffee, Croissant and Slippers ready, I'm going to break it down for you. 

[This post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9cqsvb/what_youve_missed_recap_of_year_1_for_new/) contains every thing from Y1 Launch and the changes applied to each section. It has a lot of reading but is extremely helpful in helping players pin point when they stopped playing and what changed afterwards. It's also great for pin pointing issues you may / may have not had and what changed since you left. The below information is what has changed for Forsaken running into Y2

First off, I want to give you a quick rundown (and a LOT of reading if you wanted to do that). This here is the [Bungie Patch Note index](https://www.bungie.net/en/Explore/Category?category=Updates). It contains every single update we have had since you stopped playing. My suggestion is to start from '[Warmind](https://www.bungie.net/en/News/Article/46849)' (released in MAY18) and make your way through to get a full taste of everything (Again, if you enjoy a lot of reading)

If you love a good reading session, there is also [So you haven't played Destiny since Curse of Osiris](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/8gim21/so_you_havent_played_destiny_since_curse_of_osiris/) which was a great 'Returning Player Guide' up until this most recent set of updates and can fill you in on some more finer details

- Random Rolls are returning for Y2 Weapons and Armour. Exotics can also roll various 'Middle Tree' Perks
- We are getting NEW subclass tress for the current Supers. 
- Time to Kill has been lowered in PVP 
- The infusion system has been changed back to D1, post TTK standard (Any weapon from the same slot can be infused)
- Many Grenades have had significant buffs (See Patch notes for full details)
- Trials and Iron Banner are once again, Power Level enabled
- Trials of the Nine has been suspended until Season 5 for re-working.
- 2 hit melee kills / one hit Shoulder Charge Kill
- Weapons have been made more Powerful across the board (Unless you're a Fusion Rifle)
- Weapon slots have been changed (Can now run Snipers, Shotties, FRs in the Special Slot as well as some Kinetic) - For a full explanation of it, see [This post: The Definitive Weapon Slot Changes List.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9a4jhy/the_definitive_weapon_slot_changes_list/). The ammo economy has been updated to help compliment this
- The Teamshot Nuts2Butts meta is all but gone just like the 'No Knight' Strategy
- More Weapons than ever are viable in both PVE and PVP
- Bows will be in the game when Forsaken Launches
- Exotics have been majorly updated to be more powerful, meaningful as a choice and to better suit situations to get you out of tight spots
- The Mod system is being completely re-worked in Warmind (Detailed below)
- The grind has returned (In Warmind and looks to be doing the same into Forsaken)
- In game secrets and discoveries are coming back 
- Lost Sectors updated to be tougher
- Masterwork weapons were added which meant they got a Stat boost and also produced Orbs on multi kills. This is expanding in Forsaken
- Masterworking of weapons has updated to 'Level up' your Weaponary to produce an extra perk, kill trackers and Orb generation on Multi Kills
- Gear Collections will let you see everything you’ve collected and what you’ve yet to find. This will be in game, much like the Kiosk system of old. Whether this means gear will be housed in Kiosks or just from your menu remains to be confirmed. Overall, a great change for collectors and gear chasers a like as it allows you to pin point things that interest you. Any gear you picked up AFTER Warmind will be added to the collection as well as retroactively what you have on your person / Vault
- Dead Ghosts are returning
- The start screen has changed from the Warmind Version so it doesn't wake up your entire street with horns)
- Bounties are back in game
- The Mod system has been completely re-worked. Elements and current blues / purples will be updated and can be broken down for new materials for Y2 
- Heroic Story Missions have RETURNED and aware Powerful Gear
- Milestones have all but being replaced by 'Challenges'. These direct you to your Weekly / New reset goals using the planets themselves, not a sidebar checklist
- Reset is now at 5pm UTC
- Reset is being updated to rotate **every 4 days** for Flashpoints, Nightfall and more. Raids will remain on a Weekly cooldown to keep us engaged and always something to play for throughout the week. It will also hold onto missed days rotations and stack over the 4 days so you don't have to worry about missing out (Unless you leave it too long, of course) - [Post here with details also](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9bails/resettimers_in_forsaken/)
- Xur will no longer be shown on the map come Forsaken. His will is not his own
- Xurs Exotic Engram will only grant Y1 Exotics after Forsaken releases
- You can preview Transmats
- Prestige Raid Lairs have been added to Eater of Worlds and Spire of Stars. Prestige entails set loadouts which rotate weekly and also Modifiers
- Prestige Raids now have extended to 2 mins 30 seconds to allow revives but with the Weapon changes thrown in, 'Hero Moments' are a lot more viable
- Shaders can now be MASS deleted (Do this by visiting the Cryptarch)
- Vault increase to 500 slots
- Exotics from Public Events is no longer the most efficient Grind
- In Game Lore including Stories and information across the game (Coming in Forsaken)
- Clan Engrams have changed to not drop End Game loot from Raids and Trials with further changes to the clan system coming with Forsaken
- Much of the games play has been converted to Challenges and Quests which will be in your pursuits tab in your inventory
- Guardians have a voice again in Forsaken and can speak in cut scenes
- Forsaken brings with it new achievements and trophies (Xbox / PS)
- Economy Changes including needing planetary materials to upgrade weapons
- HVTs, Chests and Lost Sectors all give higher volumes of planetary Mods to help supplement the change to upgrades
- Gambit is an entirely new concept of PVE/P where 2 teams compete against PVE enemies with oppurtunites to engage the other team to stop them. Gambit a unique activity with Destiny and entirely new concept to what we've seen so far. Merging PVE and PVP into one whilst bringing a competitive and what looks like a hell of a lot of fun to the game mode. **You will need to own Forsaken to play this**

> 4v4 (With Dance off before the game starts)

> Players will begin on 2 sides of a map facing off against PVE enemies

> Defeating these will drop 'Motes' for you to 'Bank' in a terminal. Doing so will 'Block' the opposing team from banking motes until they clear a wave blocking them, timer or potential other mechanics not yet seen

> A portal will open during the game mode allowing a player from that side to jump across and engage the other team (PVP) and defeat them to throw off their rhythm and help your team gain advantage

> After so much bank is collected a Boss Wave will spawn, beat the boss first and win the Round

#GAMBIT IS AVAILABLE FOR ONE DAY ONLY STARTING SEPTEMBER 1ST 2018

I probably have missed something but I feel like this covers the main gripes and what people *want* to see from D2. If there is anything burning or you think is of note, please feel free to let me know.

My genuine advice here is to just boot up the game and let it all flow. You will feel an immediate difference with the changes listed above, below and in the patch notes and it's worth experiencing yourself so you can take it in again. If you feel overwhelmed or need an answer, you can always ask the question! But on the face of it, internet strangers won't make you love the game, only you and your experiences can do that

---

**Mix and Match - Brief Weapon Slot changes run down**

This has caused confusion when you read it but I assure you, in practise it works a treat. In short, power weapons have been mixed around back into the Special slot. Meaning you can carry Shotguns, Fusions and Snipers in the second slot as well as the usual power weapons

**Primary ammo**

- Auto rifles
- Bows
- Hand cannons
- Pulse rifles
- Scout rifles
- Sidearms
- SMGs


**Special ammo**

- One Shot Grenade Launchers
- Fusion Rifles
- Shotguns
- Sniper Rifles
- Trace Rifles

**Heavy / Power ammo**

- Drum Loaded grenade launchers
- Linear Fusion Rifles
- Rocket launchers
- Swords

Notable weapons staying in the Power slot: Legend of Acrius, Tractor Cannon, Whisper of the Worm, Sleeper Simulant (Would always stay as it's a Linear Fusion) and DARCI

Quotes from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9a17kj/everything_you_need_to_know_for_destiny_2_forsaken/) for more explanation on ammo

> Gone are the days of Kinetic, Energy, and Power ammo. All ammo types from Destiny are being repurposed in Forsaken. Primary weapons will take white ammo, similar to Destiny 1. This ammo will drop plentifully from almost every enemy in the game. Next comes Special Weapons, which will take the much rarer green ammo. Finally, Power weapons will take the rarest purple ammo. The rarer the ammo is, the more powerful the gun that takes it is.

> Ammo in PvP is being changed. Primary ammo is available almost all the time, while Guardians will spawn in with two rounds of special ammo. Guardians will drop one round of special ammo upon death, and when the Guardian dies he/she will respawn with 2 rounds in their special weapon. If a player is running two special weapons, the ammo will be distributed, meaning one round in each gun. Finally, heavy ammo will spawn similarly to power ammo today, if not a tinge rarer.

---

**Mod material - Mod system re-work**

When Forsaken Launches all your mods will break down into stuff that you’ll need to turn in to Banshee to get 2.0 mods.

Energy and power weapons will no longer be able to change their element with mods, as elemental mods will no longer exist. Again, these can all be broken down into materials which can go towards new gear in Forsaken

The new Mod system will offer benefits to your playstyle with things such as 'increased in air accuracy' and 'radar cooldown reduction' to help you make meaningful builds in your playstyle

The will be available from the Gunsmith as well as RNG drops from him on level ups. 


---

**Patch work - Quick fire round**

**Where's Cayde?**

On holiday.. His Stashes have been removed and is no longer included in Weekly Reset

Small details to sweep up any lingering questions

**What will be the new soft cap / Power levels?**

Soft cap: Unknown yet. Max: 600

**When's the new Raid out?** 

Friday the 14th of September

**Why won't my patch work?**

- Try: Hard reset. Turn it on and off again. Cancel and restart. Patience. [Bungie Help](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=bungie+help&rlz=1C1GGRV_enGB751GB751&oq=bungie+help&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60j69i64.1494j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). 

**Weapon Slot changes?**

[This post: The Definitive Weapon Slot Changes List.](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9a4jhy/the_definitive_weapon_slot_changes_list/)

**So whats the new meta?**

Too early to say but EVERYTHING is feeling strong right now. My top picks so far are -

- Jade Rabbit
- Suros Regime
- Orewings Maul
- Fighting Lion
- Ikelos Shotty
- Ikelos Sniper
- Midnight Coup
- Widows Bite (Sniper)
- Alone as a God (Sniper / Kinetic Slot)
- Telesto (Besto Molesto the Resto).
- Legend of Acrius

Keep an eye on r/DTG and r/crucibleplaybook (PVP dedicated sub) for further developments

**WHERE HAVE MY WEAPONS GONE**

Your shotties / anything else that have switched around are in your postmaster

Your collections are currently inaccessible for the time being due to Space Magic on Bungies end. Don't worry and Pardon their dust

**I just got some Forsaken gear!**

Forsaken Gear is currently dropping from 'Powerful Engrams'. Weapons / Armour with Random Rolls although require a higher level than we currently are to use.

Dismantling them can drop Bounties, Special boosts such as a 'Glimmer explosion' variant and more

**How do I know if I got a God Roll?**

A God Roll is determined by the best possible stat boosts for that Archetype. A Scout for example would benefit a lot from Stability or a Hand Cannon from Range. Check your weapons carefully before dismantling just incase you land a gem. 

For questions, visit r/SharditKeepit

For more in depth numbers, see the [Massive Breakdown Soreadsheet](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/9b9mpm/massive_breakdown_weapon_stats_spreadsheet_has/?st=JLFHEG1R&sh=7cc04e00)

**What is happening to Y1 armour?**

It's basically becoming a collection piece as it won't have Random Rolls / perks. It will go into your collections page though so don't worry if you like to keep it for trophies / Frabjous dance parties

**Same but Weapons?**

Same again, going in collection / can be infused. Issue is, they won't get the new Masterwork bonuses and infusion costs have increased a lot. There are some Y2 versions of old favourites though such as Better Devils so replacements will come thick and fast

**Why can't I Pre-order?**

This can be a number of reasons so I'll cover most common ~~reach~~ work arounds

- Sign into your account on the website
- Go onto the website itself of the store rather than console
- Amazon don't do digital pre-orders for Activision (So I'm told?)
- Visit your local retailer and discuss it with them if there's nothing on X Y Z site. Or use the phone to get in touch with them 

**Will the Pre-order bonus end?**

No, it will last up until launch

The pre order bonuses are confirmed to be released in the game eventually. So all is not lost

**So we have to pay for Quality of life changes?**

No. The Sandbox and updates are free to ALL players. All you are missing, is Forsaken content

**This seems pricey, I'm unsure**

Play the game again. For real. These changes lead into Forsaken, not as a way around it. You can play all your current content amped up and weapon slot crazy

**Can I still finish my Solstice Gear / MoT?**

No. You can still masterwork it though if you reached the Purple resplendent set.

You can still get your Tee shirt though but that again, is on a time limit

**When is the next Iron Banner and can I play it without Forsaken?**

September and Yes, you can. It is Power Level enabled so without Forsaken, you may be hindered in that respect. 50 levels below usually means you will do 1 shot faster than at a matched level

**Trials?**

Same deal except Trials is suspended for the foreseeable for tuning and changes

**PS Exclusives?**

Y1 PS exclusives will be dropping on PC and Xbox when Forsaken launches. Yes, Y2 has more of them also

3 DLCs have been revealed which will follow up Y2D2. In Winter 2018, named 'Black Armoury', Spring 2019 named 'Jokers Wild' and Summer 2019 named 'Penumbra' respectively. A form of 'Season pass' will be available for Y2D2 named the 'Annual Pass' and can be pre-order now along with Forsaken.

For official rundown and pre-order links, visit the [Destiny the Game](https://www.destinythegame.com/forsaken) website

**Annual Pass**

The Annual Pass is not your typical DLC Season Pass. This pass WILL NOT add story campaigns to Destiny 2 but would rather fill out End Game content and provide more adventures, gear and challenges to take on in the world of D2

Bungie have emphasised expectation of these add-ons to be seen accordingly. They won't provide a cinematic campaign but will instead focus on content drops throughout year 2.

**The Last Word**

This *feels* like Destiny 2 and Forsaken is only going to add to that experience

PVP feel exciting, fast and fresh. PVE genuinely makes you feel like a God Slayer again with what you can pick and choose whilst also switching around and choosing amped up Exotic weapons and armour

Still sceptical? I encourage you to be. Wait for reviews and feedback if you still don't know what to do. It's 100% fair enough. r/DTG will be here for your questions and I'll be in the Reef waiting for you should you drop by

Let's get this Party started, Guardians

### EVIDENCE #9: I think the next 4-6 weeks might just be the breaking point for Medicine

First I am in EMS so I am in the hospital like 15% -20% of my shifts. But man, I see you all hospital providers broken and abused. It's sickening. I love a healthy, mildly antagonistic competition and rivalry between EMS and the hospital - I do. I admit I internally giggled at an MD bitching about not enough light and space in a room to do an intubation, but it was never with malice. Now, all we can do is just watch from the back of our trucks as you are systematically and slowly decimated. 

I came to this realization from an EMS shift I had 2 days ago. The ER waiting room and beds were filled far, far beyond capacity to the point *the wait was 15 hours to be seen from triage*. Why? Unvaccinated Covid patients and people wanting to get a Covid test, a huge majority also not vaccinated.

I hauled like 4 patients from second floors to the ambulance in a surgical mask over an N95 or wearing my P100. I run half marathons but it was absolutely exhausting. And then, those patients get sent to triage. Triage. Why? Because half the ER rooms were respiratory isolation. Patients who need telemetry are sitting in hallway beds. I had to leave a woman having runs of V-tach in a hallway bed. I have never had to run a strip on a patient after getting them on the hospital bed *to document they had not coded before I left.* 

We had a double Level 1 Trauma from a pedestrian struck, and it was fucking chaos in the ER.  Two Trauma/ICU/surgical teams being pulled away from absolutely massive patient loads upstairs and nurses just having to deal with a patient actually masturbating in the hallway to then run to a double trauma made for tempers white hot with rage. I have never seen such apathy and disconnect from nursing staff before. 

I absolutely and totally live for the chaos of EMS. I have been doing it 22 years and to this day I love to rock out to complete shit shows and high stress calls. In the past, I could not wait for that shift of nonstop calls and a 12 hour high-dose natural epinephrine infusion. But when I see the patients I literally break my joints and back to take care of end up screwed and abandoned because some people just can't be sensible and civil, it fucking boils my blood. I mean to the point I am almost done. Like done. 

My point is all of these things on their own may not seem like a huge deal. But this time, collectively there seems to be less of a **nebulous** anger, desperation, and hopelessness, and to me it really seems *it is gaining focus at the system*, and toward those who just refuse to take small steps to care for themselves. 

When things are intensely focused, a fire is caused, and to me that fire is coming as Omicron is about to show us things that have never been seen. 

There is a great quote from the movie Event Horizon: *Hell is just a word. The reality is, much, much worse.*

Local news in Upstate South Carolina just ran a news segment because a lady with chest pain had to wait 6 hours in the ER and \*gasp\* the small trash bin was overflowing! It reminded me that the general public has ZERO fucking clue that our healthcare system is about to implode.

When I keep saying 2022 is going to start off feeling more like 2020 Part 2 people say “no, it’s different. We have vaccines and know what treatments work better.”

My response is usually: you’re right. It is different. We have 20-25% less staff, the remaining staff is burnt to a crisp and on the edge of quitting, no one is willing to go the extra mile or put in more effort than is minimally required due to the burn out, and the general public doesn’t give a fuck about healthcare workers or basic safety precautions anymore, even people who were initially very cautious. It’s different, all right. It’s worse.

I personally think we should consider making regional Covid hospitals where people with symptomatic Covid get diverted and there are how many beds there are, but they don’t come to the regular EDs. Possibly accept some vaccinated people to the regular hospitals. I think they did something like this in China and were able to build it in about 2 weeks.

In family medicine we do a lot of testing in the parking lot, we only do rapid tests though so take those results with a big grain of salt. Our main focus is prevention, we have been giving the Moderna vaccine since the day it rolled in to the state, and now we are all navigating the muddy waters of post-COVID care. 

I had a breaking point of sorts yesterday, a patient was in for renewal of pain meds and he starts in on an impromptu lecture on how COVID is a hoax (A HOAX?! Look around you my dude) and how the vaccine is a form of government control. Just moments before, I came out of a room with a woman who was broken, sobbing the most painful tears of grief - she lost her two adult children, husband, and elderly parents to COVID - she was the only one vaccinated, the only one left (and as you all know there is NO JOY in "I told you so.") I looked at the guy giving me the same old blah, blah, blah, bullsh*t lecture knowing that he could easily be the next one to suffer the same fate, I held my hand up to stop his tirade, and said, "I just can't with you today," and I walked out of the exam room. 

I learned something new recently, my sister is an RN and she works at an LTACH facility (never knew what this was). This has be the most scary place of all, it's where people with COVID (and other problems) go to LIVE. They live a life on a vent or a trach until the family can stop fighting and let go. Essentially, a body farm. Very few make it out. I asked my sister, "What are the majority of your patients?" And she replied, "COVID. All of the horribly damaged people who survived but have no life left." 

I am truly, truly in awe of the hospital staff, nurses, EMTs, paramedics, respiratory techs, tech techs, PAs, NPs, and the doctors who run to the fire every single day. I'm just a family medicine PA sitting on the sidelines trying to help as much as possible. I cheer you all on and pray for each and every one of you every day, you have my utmost respect and enduring gratitude.

### EVIDENCE #10: Wearing Power Armor to a Magic School (60/?)

In a surprising turn of events, Thacea stepped up to the plate almost immediately, turning to the rest of the group with a look of resolve on her face that might’ve actually betrayed a genuine *hint* of excitement. “I volunteer to be the next on this roster.” The avinor’s speaking mannerisms remained largely the same - polite and reserved. Yet similar to her features, she seemed to allow a small sliver of genuine excitement to color her voice as she stood up at about the same time Thalmin began packing away his projector.

This gave me and the two guys some room for smalltalk.

“So, what did you think?” Thalmin began with an expectant grin.

“About your realm?” Ilunor replied almost immediately.

“Yes, Vunerian, what else is there that I could have alluded to?”

“Well, I’ve said my piece.” Ilunor responded with a shrug. “An average run-of-the-mill adjacent realm, perhaps even less than average if I were to delve into any critical analysis of what was shown.” 

Thalmin let out a growl at this, which prompted me to add my two cents in before the two could get into another verbal spat.

“Well I thought your realm was very impressive, Thalmin.” I spoke earnestly, and with a hint of giddiness, as the realization of having just been thrust into a *second* fantasy realm was really starting to sink in now. “From the walls, to the buildings, and even the streets, everything was just like being transported back in time.” I spoke with a palpable wanderlust in my voice.

Thalmin’s smile grew for the first half of that, but a questioning glare began forming just as quickly at the latter statement. “Back in time?”

“Oh, sorry, it’s just, we had similar architectural and city-planning methods as you before things started erm…” 

*Industrializing?*

“... changing.” I decided on a vaguer descriptor instead. “But erm, yeah! Speaking frankly, it’s impressive to see your infrastructure projects, what with the roads, public spaces like the bathhouse, an actual sewage system, and then some! It’s honestly rather impressive!”

“Heh. The newrealmer is impressed by the unseen underbelly of civilization it seems?” Ilunor interjected snidely.

“Well, it’s more like I have an appreciation for what actually makes a city, and a civilization *tick*, Ilunor.” I snapped back just as quickly at his cheap quips. “Not everything is about the most impressive castle or the fanciest of monuments. It’s these more subtle aspects of civilization that truly shows the development of a nation.” 

This seemed to genuinely baffle the Vunerian, as he cocked his head in confusion, as if being faced with an utterly foreign concept.

“Public works are not the measure with which I would base my analyses on the impressiveness of a civilization, Booker.” He stated plainly, frankly, and in no uncertain terms. “It may come third or fourth in my consideration of that title, but it should be more of an afterthought than a primary aspect of consideration.” He eventually shrugged, after parsing the thought in his mind for a few moments. “But what can I expect from the mentality of a *commoner*. You see the mundane as the grand, and the grand as the mundane… or perhaps the grand is simply too far above you to consider at all.” 

I was just about to put in a few choice words in response to that before Thacea suddenly returned with her sight-seer already almost fully assembled.

“I do hope I’m not interrupting anything?” Thacea addressed all three of us with a questioning gaze.

“No, not at all.” Ilunor replied promptly, which prompted me to just sigh in response, before shrugging. 

“Nothing of value was spoken, and nothing of value was lost as a result.” I chimed in with a side-eye directed towards the Vunerian.

Thacea, upon reading the room, decided to continue unabated. 

“Before I commence my sight-seer experience, I would like to note that this particular chapter of my sight-seer was modified to be more of a *visual* experience, as opposed to Thalmin’s more narrative-driven piece. I must also warn you, that you may experience motion sickness and its accompanying maladies such as dizziness, nausea, and the sort.”

“And you assume this because you believe all of us to have *never* experienced flight before?” Ilunor abruptly interjected, prompting the avinor princess to nod once in reply.

“That is correct, however I did not mean any offense by-”

“Of course you didn’t.” He continued with that same, cocky, shit-eating grin as if excited to explain just exactly *how* Thacea was in the wrong here. “And I take no offense, of course. For you are correct in assuming that *most* land dwellers are, of course, *bound* by their physical limitations. However… the fact of the matter is, *I* am not *like* **most** land-dwellers, Thacea Dilani. For *I* am a Vunerian of the house of Rularia. As such, you must keep in mind both my draconic heritage, and my personal privileges. The former granting me immunity to the maladies commonly found from a land-dweller experiencing that which was not meant for them - flight. The latter being my inherent experience in riding *drakes*, for my family owns both the leisurely and *combat* varietals.” 

Thacea took all of this with stride, simply nodding once at the Vunerian’s long winded explanation, managing to pull the wind out of his sails through what was effectively a simple acknowledgement to a grandiose display of verbiage.

I, however, couldn’t help but to let out a long sigh, as I first turned towards the EVI to add a small note to my list of growing ideas.

“EVI?”  


**“Yes, Cadet Booker?”**

“Make sure we include a few intra-atmo aircraft in the demo, maybe somewhere in the background while we show off the city.” 

**“Affirmative, Cadet Booker.”** 

Once that was done, I quickly turned towards Ilunor with a cock of my head, all the while directing my speech to Thacea. “No offense taken here as well, Thacea. For I too have had my fair share of experiences in flight. Both civilian and military, in aircraft and in power armor.” I spoke in no uncertain terms, prompting the Vunerian to glare at me with a look of someone who’d just been challenged by a perceived *lesser* opponent.

“It is one thing to create flying *artifices*, Booker. That much I can see through your use of *drones*. It is, however, another thing entirely to create what you claim are *aerial-borne vessels*.” 

“Listen, Ilunor. How about we settle this with me just *showing* it to you when we get to my presentation” I answered politely and with a bemused smile under my helmet. “For now, let’s just get to Thacea.”  

That little calling-out of Ilunor’s bluff seemed to stir something within both Thacea and Thalmin, as both met each other’s gaze for a moment, only for me to raise a single hand, calling off the argument as abruptly as it began.

“The floor is all yours, Thacea.” 

Thacea, with a cautious yet appreciative nod, continued with another wave of her hands; prompting another spike of mana radiation to precede a holographic projection of a sight that I had not at all expected. 

The world that now consumed our field of view, save for the coffee table that the sight-seer rested on and the couches we sat atop of, was a wooden galley. However, that in and of itself wasn’t the most unexpected part of this whole projection. No, the galley itself looked more than par for the course for your typical medieval-renaissance fantasy faire. 

What was decidedly *not* your typical fantasy faire was what was immediately in *front* of the ship. As the POV of this particular holographic recording wasn’t just staring out at some typical ye olde port with a cathedral or palace tower poking through a sea of low-rise structures.

No.

What we saw didn’t look like it couldn't have been built in the renaissance, or any other period in history that popular fantasy had requisitioned for its aesthetics. 

Because what we saw in front of us now, was undeniably, in every way possible… a city skyline.

Hundreds upon hundreds of towers rose above the sheer cliff faces of this island, forming what was in effect a coherent, cohesive, and strangely *modern* sight that looked absolutely out of place, especially from the vantage point of a wooden galley that looked like it’d been pulled out of the 15th century. 

I was about to raise a fair few questions about this, if not for the silent POV suddenly getting up from their seat, the whole perspective now turning to a precariously *unsecured* side of the vessel with not a single handrail, rope, or any sort of barrier existing between the ship’s deck and the open ocean below. 

The POV avinor paused for a moment, as if considering their next step, before suddenly and without warning *launching* themselves straight off the side of the ship. Hurling themselves at *maximum speed*, as fast as their chicken legs could muster, and for a moment losing altitude as they neared the waterline; before leveling out and then ascending straight *up*. The whole sequence took a total of barely ten or so seconds, but in those ten seconds, I could practically feel my gut *churning*. 

Ilunor, however, looked absolutely worse for wear if his dazed eyes and greening cheeks were of any indication. His bluff now falling flat as he all but needed to grip on tight to the plush armrests of his recliner to steady himself. 

The footage continued irregardless of the Vunerian’s condition however, as the video now felt like one of those high-quality nature docs that had a high-res camera strapped to the back of a migratory bird. 

As the world around us was now nothing but empty sky, and the ship beneath us continued to fade further and further away into the distance, until it was nothing but a small brown blob in the vast canvas of deep azure that was the ocean. 

These observations however didn’t remain valid for long. As without any warning save for a few high-pitched *chirps*, came an absolute *flurry* of colors in the form of an entire flock of birds. As the POV avinor in question joined what was ostensibly an entire *air lane’s* worth of fellow avinor. 

Avinors whose colors ranged from bright hot pink, to dull browns and beiges, to more colorful variants of blue, oranges, and reds. 

The entire flock flew in surprisingly coordinated unison through the clouds, before banking *hard* to the right, breaking through the cloud layer once more, rapidly approaching their intended destination - the city.

However, as we got closer, the finer details of these towers became increasingly more vivid; and with that came several revelations that started to frame this whole city in a more period-accurate light.

What were tall, modern skyscrapers from afar, now looked to be more akin to exceptionally elongated and stretched out towers of stone and concrete, with not a single structure containing more than a few panes of glass. 

And what I’d first assumed to be window frames from afar now revealed themselves to be far, *far* bigger than that. Clearly intended for something other than just looking out of. 

As every floor of every building contained what was in effect, some form of a balcony, with a wide open outcropping that could fit a whole avinor with their wings outstretched. 

These weren’t just decorative or aesthetic elements of design.

They were functional, in a way that I’d never thought to imagine before. 

From balconies to outcroppings to perches and more, these were elements of design that were conducive to the avinor lifestyle.

A lifestyle of *three dimensions*, unbound by the limitations of arms and legs, afforded to them by their gift of flight.

This was demonstrated almost immediately as the flock began to disperse upon entering into the city limits, as *hundreds* of them began their approach to several of the outlying towers at the outskirts of town, using those perches, balconies, and entrances exactly as I’d imagined them to. 

However, instead of entering any of those shorter buildings, our hologram’s POV began entering into what I could only describe as a *lane* of traffic. An invisible, non-demarcated series of flight paths that ran parallel and above to the city’s winding streets. Above and below us were distinct, seemingly never-ending lanes’ worth of avinor. Thousands of them commuted in these surprisingly accident-free and well regulated flight corridors, as if everyone instinctively *knew* the movements of another, as they all made micro adjustments to veer, swerve, shift, or alter their course in order to avoid mid-air collisions with their fellow commuters. 

This seemingly impossible and endless string of acrobatics continued as our POV flew their way between vast stretches of towers, eventually finding themselves barreling straight towards one. 

The flight lanes eventually dispersed, leaving only a few brave avinor to do what I’d only seen professional drone operators do for sport.

They flew straight *through* a skyscraper, entering through an admittedly large open balcony, flying through what *looked* to be a public concourse with a reception counter and concierge, passing by trolleys, couches, shelves, and even a precarious looking vase at one point, before flying out the other side of the building in the span of just a few seconds.

Everything felt like a complete blur by this point, but the real piece de resistance was still yet to come.

The avinor’s flightpath soon found themselves traveling into a part of the city that grew higher and higher with elevation, until finally, there was a strange, almost eerily empty clearing. A clearing that lasted for a good mile or so, acting as a buffer zone between the rest of the city and what was undoubtedly the seat of power of the whole place.

A stereotypical fantasy castle, with very little in the way of *practical* defenses compared to that of Thalmin’s home fortress. 

It looked as if someone had taken one of those *aesthetically-minded* ‘castles’ from the 19th century and simply *stretched* it out vertically. Creating something that was a cross between the Plaza Hotel from historic NYC, and one of those aforementioned 19th century castles built only for aesthetics in an era way *way* past the utilitarian age of castles. 

In fact, it looked eerily similar to that one particular castle that was prominently featured in that latest Civ building game as an ancient wonder…

Something starting with an N…

“EVI, help me out here. Search the historic databases for a castle in the EF, probably Germany or something. Something starting with an N. Featured recently in that civ game as a wonder. Something that rhymes with Lichtenstein.” 

**“Neuschwanstein Castle.”** The EVI responded blandly, bringing up the exact image of the castle I was looking for.

“THAT’S IT! Okay, thanks EVI.” 

**“Note: the name does** ***not*** **rhyme with the standard pronunciation of the state of Liechtenstein.”**

“Whatever, EVI, you at least got what I meant.”

“Soooooo Booker, what do you *think*?” An unfortunately familiar voice came in at the tail end of my back and forth with EVI, gesturing at the holographic projection.

I took a few seconds to come up with an answer. “I mean it’s-” 

But by that point, it was too late. 

“Hah! Awestruck by a slightly *above average* adjacent realm, are we now, Booker?” Ilunor couldn’t help but to butt in with a sly grin. 

“Not really, no. And erm, I don’t mean any offense by that of course, Thacea.” I addressed Thacea first, before shifting back to Ilunor. “In fact, the castle reminded me of a few structures we have back home.” 

Ilunor didn’t quite buy it, narrowing his eyes, and responded accordingly. “I *highly* doubt that to be the case, newrealmer-”

I promptly shut him down by grabbing my tablet, flipping it over, and displaying exactly what I’d most recently searched for. 

The Neuschwanstein Castle. 

This 19th century feat of engineering seemed to raise some eyebrows in Thalmin, garnering something of a respectable nod from Thacea, but seemed to only garner a shrug from Ilunor. 

“So you *don’t* live in mud and stick huts.” He spoke unenthusiastically. “What a surprise that the royal family of Earthrealm lives in a grand palace in the middle of the woods. Probably surrounded by the peasantry that took what… a hundred? A thousand years to painstakingly build what we can build in a blink of an eye?” He cackled incessantly.

“Nobody lives there, Ilunor.” I stated plainly. “It’s a historical site from a bygone era. We keep it because of its historic significance, and we keep the area around it wooded for the same reason. Or rather, environmental protection acts but that’s a whole other story. Suffice it to say, that’s *not* where our leaders reside. But… I guess you’ll see when I get to my realm.” 

I would savor the look on his face when we got to my demo. 

“Anyways, please do continue Thacea. I’m sorry for derailing your presentation.” I quickly added, prompting the princess to nod hesitantly in response, as if trying to gauge and pick apart the minor details of Earth just from that one image alone. 

“As I was saying, what you’ve just bore witness to was my home city, the capital of Aetheronrealm, the Isle of Towers. What you currently see here is the seat of the Royal family, the High Palace of Dilani.”

“So that’s where you live?” I shot back instinctively.

“Yes.” Thacea nodded. “More specifically, I spent most of my days confined to the tainted branch here.” The hologram projected a series of sparkly borders around one of the towers that jutted out laterally from the castle.

I nodded once, silently, not wanting to dig into that matter further. “Apologies if I brought up an awkward talking point, Thacea.” I openly apologized. 

“It’s quite alright, Emma.” Thacea responded with a polite chirp and just as quickly moved on. 

The rest of the city was promptly shown across the next thirty minutes, what amounted to a civilization built upon verticality and their gift of flight. 

Suffice it to say, there were *a lot* of questions following that demonstration, at least from my end as I began trying to pick apart *everything* Thacea had just shown us.

“So, are *all* avinor cities like this?” I began with an excitable breath.

“No, others rely more heavily on their natural surroundings to attain similar ends. With many cities having been carved into natural rock formations, cliff faces, and plateaus.” 

“Then why put all this effort into making the capital an artificial facsimile of what you could’ve more easily done with a cliff face?”

“The Isle of Towers has its roots in heavy historical legacy, Emma. Moreover, it began from desperation out of a group of avinor trapped from returning to the mainland due to a centuries-long storm. From there, they innovated, learning new magics to facilitate and accelerate means of both production and construction, allowing for the feats of engineering we now see today. Moreover, after the storms cleared, the isle became a hub of commerce as it sat between the flight-paths of the northern and southern migratory routes. Thus, after the Nexian reformation, it was quickly redesignated as the Aetheronrealm capital.”

I nodded silently all throughout, the EVI taking notes all throughout, and my own mind all but ravenously *consuming* this new bird-lore. 

“And-”

“Are we quite *finished* with this *Aetheronrealm* discussion, Booker?” Ilunor interjected. Although this time it wasn’t so much just pride talking, as I could visibly see him shaking from excitement.

Clearly giddy at the prospects of being *next*.

I craned my head towards Thacea. “Are you alright with continuing this Q and A at another time then, Thacea?”

The avinor princess nodded once in reply, prompting Ilunor to all but *cackle* excitedly with a gremlin-esque series of snickers, before running off to his room and bringing back his own sight-seeer. 

His device was fundamentally different from the pair’s. As unlike Thalmin’s, it looked *new*, and unlike Thacea’s, it was *sleeker*, with gold trimmings, silver finishes, and fine polish making it look like something out of a 27th century corpo lord’s modern art gallery. Even the crystals he inserted in seemed to glow *brighter*, and the iridescent fluid he used to power the whole thing was just that little bit more *lustrous*. 

“I hope you’re ready, newrealmer.” Ilunor began with a shit-eating grin on his face so wide that for a moment he looked like something straight out of a cartoon. “Because what you are about to see, is the result of the guiding light, the nurturing hand, and the awe-inspiring *power* of Nexian patronage.” 

The room around us was once more bathed in a white light, which transitioned seamlessly into yet another 3D panoramic experience. 

However, there was something different about this one.

Unlike the previous two’s projections that felt like there was a clearly defined POV, as if the whole thing was recorded from a single camera with all the drawbacks that came with it… this image felt eerily stable. It was as if we’d immediately jumped from a senior-high film project, to something of genuinely decent quality coming out of a legacy film house. 

The stabilized image I was met with was that of a vast expansive valley, one flanked on all sides by hilly terrain, with a seemingly endless expanse of mountainous peaks that crested in the background every which way we looked. 

“The trail of victory.” Ilunor began his unique brand of narration, contrasting Thalmin’s more rustic approach to his presentation, and Thacea’s minimalistic approach to hers. “The path of heroes. The road of success. Many names have been given to this long winding stretch of road. A pilgrimage that many a lesser-Vunerian, and those of partial draconic heritage must trek at least *once* in their small lives.” 

His words were somehow *reverberating* throughout the valley now, as if there was some sort of a sound projection system that had manifested around us.

“Though the names for it are many, and much of them are quite warranted, none come close to the name which I believe best suits the epic nature of that which is my home.” 

The scenery that surrounded us slowly, but surely, accelerated. Traveling down winding and twisting paths, until suddenly, it simply became a straight, uncompromising road. Paved, fenced, and well maintained for even industrial era standards, looking like something hailing from the age of concrete and asphalt, at around the dawn of paracrete and unisphalt.

The roads continued ever onwards, becoming more ambitious with its infrastructure projects as it crossed streams, rivers, lakes, and eventually… entire canyons and valleys. Bridge after bridge was crossed, each one grander and more elaborate than the next. With boring beam bridges eclipsed by arch bridges, then by suspension, then truss, then cantilever bridges, and so on and so forth. 

It was as if the Vunerian was trying to *also* demonstrate the superiority of his realm’s infrastructure; perhaps prompted by my earlier remarks on that very topic.

And to be honest… it showed, with many works of engineering looking as if they’d been pulled right out of early-modernity. 

This eventually culminated in a series of ambitious tunnels that ran *straight* through mountain after mountain, giving Norway a run for its money in the tunneling business.

These tunnels weren’t the bare stone type either, with each tunnel being entirely encased in a white seamless material, shiny, and similar to marble.

After about ten whole minutes of this fast-forwarded journey, which I imagine would’ve taken *days* if not *weeks* to accomplish by horseback and foot respectively, we finally arrived at an unusually large clearing. 

A large *flat* space, at the foot of several mountains.

However, as the ‘camera’ panned up, higher and higher still, our eyeballs forced to scale the sheer cliff-face that was the mountain, we suddenly reached a point where the mountain just… abruptly *stopped*.

About halfway up the tapering conical formation, where the midsection of the mountain *should* have been, was *nothing*.

Several double takes were taken by the whole gang, including myself, as we looked around us, staring at the *other* mountains that at first seemed normal, but upon closer inspection… had suffered the exact same fate.

All around us, were about seven mountains cleaved halfway up to their summits. A cut that looked so clean that it felt as if there was a graphical error, a bad glitch in the system, or some passable photo-doctoring going on.

“For I call it, the grand carpet to the throne at the foot of the heavens. A lengthy name, but I believe you will come to understand exactly *why* I believe that name to be most fitting.”

None of us responded, each of us transfixed in our own way as the video resumed its hastened pace, traveling closer and closer still until several oddities started becoming apparent. 

First, was the presence of *thousands upon thousands* of small outcroppings in the base of the mountain. Which, upon closer inspection, were open-air terraces. Terraces which housed entire air wings’ worth of drakes, all lined up, and sitting as if ready for action at a moment’s notice.

More details quickly became apparent as we abruptly scaled *up* the mountain, rising through a small layer of clouds to confirm what was hinted at from the foot of the mountain.

A perfectly *flat* surface at the midsection of a mountain, a result of a clean cut.

But what was *on* that flat surface however, was what was truly remarkable.

An entire *city*, a multi-tiered city that was divided not with walls, but with *height* itself. As what was a flat surface from first glance soon turned out to be a tiered landscape fashioned after a layer-cake. With each city layer separated by a good solid hundred or so feet of rock that went uncompromisingly up at a straight angle, repeating itself about ten distinct times, with each perfectly round and concentric layer becoming smaller and smaller with each change in elevation; before arriving at a large, grandiose, over-the-top castle that stood proudly at its peak.

The whole city looked sort of like the city of Omushu from Vatara: The Final Wind Shifter. 

“My home, my dear *peers*.” Ilunor announced proudly, allowing the video to continue on its own now, as we zipped straight through each of the layers of the city, going from the outermost layer that rivaled even Thalmin’s best developed areas in terms of its build quality and general aesthetics, through each of the layers that became increasingly more developed, more intricate in its designs, and sparser in its population. Most of the structures here were constructed out of a similar material to the paths that were paved between them - a pure-white stone that glistened in the sunlight. 

Open and public spaces were surprisingly abundant, as were literal *magma pits* surrounded by some sort of a wooded park that seemed entirely impervious to the heat permeating around them. 

“How-”

“I’m glad you asked, newrealmer.” Ilunor responded with a smarmy smile. “For you see, this was all the work of a single person. A *gift*, a *monument*, a practical military act, and a *message* all in one. All courtesy of his Eternal Majesty himself. Oh I’m sure we will touch upon it plenty in our history classes, but I would be remiss if I did not share a generous glimpse.” Ilunor continued, his speech interrupted by the occasional manic bout of pride-filled laughter. “This entire mountain range was once home to the seven great dragon clans of the past. And my people… were once all but unwitting *servants* to said clans. Bound to instincts… until the light of civilization opened their eyes. The elves in their infinite wisdom, and my immediate ancestors in their dissatisfaction with such a menial existence, decided to *civilize* the entirety of the region. We united to topple our draconic overlords, slaughtered them *all*, and in an act of brilliant strategic decision making, we decided to all but *destroy* the lairs with which these dragons once believed to be impregnable… by *carving open* the mountains themselves!” He announced with *glee*. “From there, the elves gifted us the former draconic lands, granting us stewardship over the entire region. We built our cities above where their lairs once stood, as a testament to our victory, of the triumph of civilization over animal savagery. Afterwhich, no longer were we known as mere *kobolds*— the elves elevating our race, imbuing my ancestors who fought alongside them with the gift of magic, creating *Vunerian-kind*.” 

My whole world all but *shattered* at that point, as what was in essence just a whole wall of lore completely rewrote everything I had initially assumed about the Vunerian. 

I turned to the pair first, gauging their reactions.

Their faces said it all however.

Or at least, Thalmin’s did.

Thacea remained unphased as was expected.

“But-”

“Oh, please maintain that shock and awe newrealmer, allow me to show you my home before we end this little *tour*.” Ilunor spoke cockily once more, descending down and towards one of the upper ringed tiers, just a few tiers shy of the palace that sat above the rest of the city. 

There, I saw an expansive mansion that would’ve put Versailles to shame. With a wide open lawn complete with a hedge maze and several magical artifacts keeping the maze itself constantly moving. Its architecture was *gaudy* too, with elements of baroque infused with high-gothic, all in the form factor of a corpo boss’ preference for *size* over practicality.

“So, newrealmer… what do you think? I doubt there’s anything in your newrealm that can match the grandeur of a crownlands-affiliate Nexian realm, even *with* that acceptably *mediocre* castle you just showed.”

I let out a sigh, turning towards Ilunor with a tired look in my eyes as I just about was ready to drop the bombshell on him.

A proverbial one of course, as this wasn’t a game of *war*, but a game of political might through a game of boastful displays.

Thankfully, this was modern humanity we were talking about.

So even a tour of my *hometown* as it were should be enough to settle things.

**“Have you dictated a course of action, Cadet Booker?”**

“Yeah, so, major themes I’m seeing here are home, hometown, city, urban development, as well as everything else more or less in between those topics that I can’t come up with right now.”

**“Affirmative Cadet Booker. Query: By hometown, do you wish to bring up your heritage town, or the Acela Megacity?”**

“Why not both?” I responded earnestly. “Both would honestly be good. Have them see the smallest of the small scale communities, then bump it up to the one of the largest cities on Earth. Should be fun right?”

**“Affirmative. Loading stated parameters now.”**

“I’m going to have to politely allow my presentation to speak for itself, Ilunor. So let’s head on over to my room. I’m afraid my *sight-seer* requires a bit more space so let’s get going.”

(Author’s Note: Hey everyone! I have an announcement to make. To keep it brief, I’m afraid I’m going to have to announce a temporary pause to posting for the next 2 weeks. This comes as a result of me being unable to change my shifts at work like I generally am able to do because most of the attending staff are going to be heading to holiday over the coming few weeks, which leaves little wiggle room with me swapping with other people from my rotation. As a result I don’t think I’ll be able to maintain the usual posting schedule without compromising on quality assurance of chapters and the standards I typically want the chapters to be. What I want most is to make sure that I can deliver as good a chapter as I can. But I’m unable to do that with the current situation with my work and studies. So with that being said, I hope this is alright with everyone. I guarantee though that we'll get back to the usual schedule after all this is done! I hope you guys have a great holiday season! :D **The next Chapter is already up on Patreon if you guys are interested in getting early access to future chapters!**)

Surprisingly informative presentation by Ilunor, though probably unintentionally so. His desire to brag has given us confirmation on how the Nexus does business, and a follow-up (FINALLY) on the 'systematic species alteration' clue from dozens of chapters ago.

So, the Nexus did the ol' regime destabilization play on the dragons, then did the mana-tech version of an uplift on the kobolds, presumably amping up their mana manipulation abilities. Presto, a brand new client state. This reaffirms that the Nexians like being the only game in town, and to maintain the status quo, genocide is just another tool in their kit. Peace with Earth will not be an option, and it never was.

Now I'm REALLY interested in seeing the gang's reaction to what humans look like. Most species we've seen so far can be seen as some kind of uplifted sapient (mana tech style), with the 'gold standard' being the Elven form. What will they make of a species whose natural form is basically shorter, stockier, round-eared elves?

Ilunor is definitely getting dunked on next year/chapter.

He is also wrong, Neuschwanstein was build in less than 20 years and no one except the bavarian king Ludwig II ever lived there, admittedly, only for 172 days. A hilarious ocurrence of nexian arrogance, because the purpose of the castle was very nexian, decoration, to cite Wikipedia: A romanticised castle, dedicated to be a personal theater stage, in honor of Richard Wagner.

The good stuff has arrived

Ok, two POV's at once? Both fantastic, too! I feel like we're being spoiled heh.

Thacea's I more or less expected, though the lore behind their capital was a very nice touch. 

But Ilunor's? Now it's apparent why he takes so much pride in his home realm and why other realms do not impress him. Though I feel like getting a jumpstart from the most powerful race in the entire Nexus is kind of a cheat lol

And now, the moment we've all been waiting for... will have to wait till next year. Oh well, life isn't always easy, so it's understandable and very much respectable that you're putting quality above regular uploads. Take care of whatever you need, and thank you for the chapter!

All of these realms are impressive, and for good reason. Magic enables ease of construction in a way no sort of technology ever could. Stone and metal become putty in the hands of a powerful user, and for those of extreme power, material limitations simply do not exist. But as said before, magic does have limitations. The way most societies have essentially genetically locked higher magic away from the masses means that without higher ranked individuals present, large scale creation on a fast time scale is more or less impossible without a veritable army. Moreover, unless you possess the sort of magic that enables large amounts of something from a whole lot of nothing, you are locked to where the materials are. Tl;dr: The bigger the project, the bigger the required hat.

It is also interesting to note how the Vunerians were uplifted rather than their dragonic overlords. The main reason for this is likely that dragons are a strategic resource, and a realm ruled by dragons is a realm that is dangerous to the nexus, not least because those dragons could ally with other realms, drastically empowering them to the point that the imbalance is broken.  How many races are there, then, who exist only to promote the Nexus and their superiority?

The man said it himself.

****Ilunor is a discount kobold****

Lol didn't see that coming. Can't wait to see his head explode next week. I can't deal with all cliffhangers. But at this rate I think I will be 30 by the time this series ends.

Great writing as always 😊

### EVIDENCE #11: Idea for Error Cubes: The Quantum Collapser

After much study and analysis, it was determined that Error Cubes have unique quantum properties. Their very existence is what the folks in R&D call "unstable, like an error in the universe..." Apparently, miners, what this means is that they can be "collapsed" into a stable state, altering their molecular structure into nearly anything you can imagine!

...and what can the Dwarves imagine? Hats! Beards! And more beards!

The Quantum Collapser would be a new installment on the space rig (I'm thinking that one tunnel above the drop pod - that has the weird "thingy" inside it that does nothing - would be a good spot). You would finally be able to spend your hard-earned Error Cubes for material good.

Exactly *which* cosmetics could you get for trading in an Error Cube? ... I'm thinking any of the cosmetics from cargo crates, lost packs, and *maaaybe* matrix core cosmetics. The shop and season pass items would be off-limits since you're supposed to get them through other means specifically.

Also yes - you'd be able to browse *every* cosmetic from crates/packs that you've yet to unlock, not a limited choice like with matrix core infusers.

*Why?* ... Because at this point there's like, what, over 700 or 800 cosmetics in the cargo/lost pack pools? That's a lot, and getting a specific one *could* take a new player literally hundreds of hours. I don't think this is a good system if a player wants a specific item they know is in those loot pools.

So, error cubes! They don't do anything now anyways besides give you 10,000 xp when collected (which is nice), and they count as a "material" which implies they could be spent somewhere... so yeah! I think it would be a nice way for players to choose *specific* cosmetics from those item pools that they want.

P. S. Maybe the machine could also have a little number display on it showing how many Error Cubes you've found - *ever* - in case you don't want to lose track of that number by spending them. Y'know, to brag to your fellow Dwarves with and such.

With the frequency that you acquire error cubes, I see no reason why this system wouldn't work. You get them so infrequently that it wouldn't alter a player's desire to participate in machine events.

```
If this is ever added to the game in any capacity, PLEASE make the animation for consuming an error cube like scrambling a Rubicks Cube! They look just like them, so I don't see why not making the "collapsing" animation just a machine turning it many many times until it explodes or something.

**The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. Eastern Gate. Local Time 1240 Hours.**

**Emma**

Shouts, cheers, and even jeers dominated the air as we made our way down the long flights of stairs *specifically designated* for these field trip ‘quests’. 

Crowds of excited onlookers, from familiar first-year faces to the less familiar senior years alike, stood just a foot apart from us field-trip questers; kept at a distance by an army of apprentices that seemed to have spawned out of nowhere. 

Banners bearing Qiv and Ping’s sigils stood high amongst the crowd, held aloft by their most endearing supporters.

In contrast, glares and sneers were shot our way whilst whispered breaths spoken in cupped hands punctuated our catty sendoff. 

However, not all was gloomy. For within this sea of chaos were a few supportive faces that purposefully waved our way; Etholin’s group being one such prime example.

The little ferret even went so far as to lob something our way with a magically-assisted throw; the mystery bow-wrapped pouch landed right on Thalmin’s outstretched palm. 

Meanwhile, a few errant voices seemed to straddle the line, providing commentary that leaned neither supportive nor dismissive. 

*“That cloak… where’d she get that?”*

*“No, no no. The question is… what sort of sigil is that?”*

*“Mmnh. Too simplistic for me.”*

*“I disagree. There’s a certain… elegance and presence in its simplicity.”*

*“You and your artistic inclinations, Lady Klevan… Anyone can arrange stars and orbs in such a pattern.”*

*“Maps. Those are rounded projections of an adjacent realm. Remember your adjacent realm geography.”*

*“Wait, but that means that the newrealm must have circumnavigated—”*

“***IF!*** *And only if that is an accurate projection.”*

*“Touche…”*

However, it was our closest allies that bore the brightest sendoff, as I took a moment against the steady tide of students to properly deliver our parting goodbyes.

“I’ll be careful, Thacea.” I began, before following it up with a cocky wink. “Knight’s promise.” 

“I shall hold you to that, Emma.” Thacea responded as we shared one final wave before turning to Ilunor. 

“Stay out of trouble, Ilunor.” Was all Thalmin said to his other half, as the Vunerian merely *hmmphed* back in response. 

Pouring out of the castle, we emerged to meet our vehicles alongside the conveyances of our fellow questers.

We’d seen a handful of others parking their vehicles alongside us earlier this morning, consisting of the typical horseless carriage, the more unique golem-drawn stagecoach, and the like. So I expected more of the same to fill up the starting line as we approached it.

… 

Suffice it to say, this was one of those times where I should’ve treated Ilunor’s foreshadowing with a little bit more weight. Because out of *everything* I could’ve imagined… *rolling wizard towers* certainly *wasn’t* on my list of expectations. 

We were thrust into what could only be described as a scene straight out of Mrowl’s Traveling Castle. With brick-and-mortar towering behemoths, each the size of one of the Academy’s guard towers, sitting high and proud above at the starting line; their sheer scale casted a shadow over our two modest-by-comparison conveyances. 

A total of four such ‘vehicles’ sat idly by on their impossible chassis. Some were wooden, others steel, while the rest were assembled from what I could only describe as *anomalous atypical materials* with visual similarities to unrendered aerogel.

The sensors couldn’t make sense of it, almost as if it was some form of—

“Ahoy ahoy!” A familiar voice beckoned my attention as both Thalmin and I quickly turned to face a familiar, somewhat amicable gaggle of faces.

“I see both of you are packin’ light!” The green and orange-yellow Gumigo spoke enthusiastically, his voice *brimming* with excitement. “Quite a refreshing sight indeed! Ain’t that right, mate?” He turned to the smallest of the gator bunch he’d chosen as his partner, who nodded along excitedly. 

“The sentiment goes both ways, Lord Gumigo.” I offered with a friendly dip of my head. “Given the stark disparity between *that*—” I pointed over towards the conical jenga towers. “—and our own modes of transportation—” I then quickly turned towards Gumigo’s stagecoach. “—I’d say we share more reasonable tastes.” 

“Aye! I empathize with the desire to bring the comforts of home along with ya. But there’s a fine line between compromising for the sake of noble comforts… and outright disconnecting yer’selves from the point of it all!” Gumigo grinned widely. “But I digress, I should’ve known you two of all people would be roughing it the hardest.” He continued as he turned towards Thalmin. “The mercenary prince and the newrealmer, a match made in the fires of adversity. A story for the ages, no doubt! I hope the two of you’ll make Academy history and actually spice things up for a change, aye?” 

“It’ll be *so much fun*!” The smaller gator spoke, his eyes lighting up with excitement. “Your spectacles make for quite a topic over tea!” 

“Perhaps it does… for the uncouth and poor-of-taste, that is.” Another voice suddenly made itself known. An often overlooked voice, one that the EVI was quick to highlight.

**\[A45 Vicini Lorsi\]**

“But for those of a more *refined palate*, there exists a near *infinite* number of topics through which *tea* would most certainly be enhanced… not *despoiled*.” He managed out through a forced chuckle, before turning to the much larger, more imposing figure behind him with an expectant and wary gaze.

However, instead of any exchange of words, the bull in question merely *hmphed* loudly, letting out a sharp, steamy exhale from both of his nostrils before wordlessly entering his carriage.

“Hey, Lord Lorsi.” I hollered, just before the fabulously frilly dressed deer entered the carriage proper. “I’m surprised your team didn’t go for one of those towers.”

“Hmmph. You mistake our *modesty* for our *station*. A superficial insult that tarnishes not our ego nor decorum. You will do well to note that our aim for this quest is to actually accomplish its goals, *not* to treat it like some holiday—” 

“That’s not what I’m saying.” I interjected, causing the deer to narrow his eyes in annoyance. “I’m just surprised you think that you can fit in that carriage with Lord Ping’s ego already taking up most of the space.” I offered through a sly chuckle.

That one jab caused the charismatic deer’s eye to twitch in place, refusing to say anything else as the carriage’s attendant closed the door shut. 

That was, until he rolled down his window, staring at us from high up. 

“Childish.” Was all he said, before rolling the window back up. 

No sooner was that awkward exchange over did the second class sovereign candidate arrive. Though unlike Lorsi’s pugnacious jabs, Qiv’s chosen partner — Uven Kroven — remained his usual silent and stoic self. 

If anything, the gorn-esque lizard merely regarded me with a simple stare, his eyes narrowing not at me nor Thalmin. Nor even the rest of the crocodile gang, but the motorcycle instead.

He even stopped just short of his own carriage to ponder it properly, cradling his snout in his hand as he did so. 

“Is that your conveyance, newrealmer?” He inquired politely.

“Yup!” 

“A… *bi*\-treader, of sorts?” 

“Yeah, I guess you could say that.” I shrugged in response.

The noble quickly summoned a book from one of his pouches — one *far* too large for the pouch itself — as he began flipping through the pages hands-free.

His eyes darted left and right, rising and falling before stopping just as the final few pages were bookended with a satisfying *thud*.

“From *where* did you procure it?” 

I quickly turned to Thalmin, the both of us locking eyes for a moment before turning back towards Qiv.

“I built it.” 

“She built it.” 

We spoke simultaneously, Thalmin going so far as to back me up by gesturing towards me with a thumb.

Qiv’s expressions grew even more quizzical, critical, and most of all… skeptical. A thousand and one words clearly buzzed behind those blue and orange eyes, until finally… he landed on a response.

“Doubtful.” Was all he said. 

“I mean, if you want to see, I can show you how I—”

“Perhaps another time, newrealmer.” He shut me down just as an attendant finished loading the last of his belongings into the carriage. 

“Perhaps we’ll simply show you on the race track, Lord Ratom.” Thalmin offered gleefully. “That is, of course, if you were planning on participating in Professor Chiska’s golem races.”

“Is that a challenge, Prince Havenbrock?” The lizard responded with a slight hint of incredulity.

“If you wish to interpret it as such, then *yes*.” I doubled down, backing Thalmin up with an affirmative nod. 

This tag-teaming prompted Qiv to let out a disinterested sigh, his eyes turning to Uven who merely stared back with the same dull expressionless visage he always wore.

However, it was clear the noble was actually gauging something *other* than Uven’s affirmation, as he seemed to be counting just how many other students’ eyes were on him during that exchange.

With a brief lull in the conversation, he seemed to hesitate before finally giving a response.

“Challenge accepted. A *friendly* challenge, of course. I hold no desire to demonstrate myself in such *sporty* affairs, after all.” He added quickly, and with a calculated sort of cadence. “Nevertheless, I do hope you do not overuse your Firstmark Seals, newrealmer. I wouldn't wish to see you exhaust your conveyance before our rally, after all.” 

Qiv eventually disappeared into the carriage without another word exchanged, prompting me to turn back to the crocodile squad.

“Now that Lord Ratom mentioned it, your conveyance *is* rather… *odd*, newrealmer.” Gumigo acknowledged.

“Yes, yes! I’d assumed it to be some form of modified monotreader capable of handling your *heft*, but now that Lord Ratom mentions it…” The smaller gator trailed off, moving to examine the motorcycle even *closer* now.

Gumigo followed suit, lowering himself and demonstrating a flexibility I hadn’t at all expected from him. His eyes narrowed as he looked *beneath* and *through* the open spaces in the bodywork, into the nitty gritty innards that weren’t covered by it. “Ah… I don’t sense any enchantments *within* it.” He mused under a surprised breath. “Is it only the armor that exudes your conveyance’s aura?” He asked, not necessarily towards me, but more so out of some open and trailing train of thought.

“But how would it…” The smaller gator questioned, before turning to meet Gumigo’s befuddled gaze.

It was around this point that the both of them turned towards me with the same shocked expression Ilunor, Thalmin, and Thacea wore on those first few days. “Newrealmer… how exactly do you expect your conveyance to even move?”

“Well, Lord Gumigo… let’s just say that there’s one or two tricks my people have learned to harness and master over the centuries. Tricks which allow for movement, comparable to many of your conveyances… *without* enchantments nor artificing.” I spoke with a wink, placing an armored hand top of a cocked hip.

“**Ahem**.” Thalmin interjected, the prince quickly gesturing towards an approaching squad and their leopard leader that had him squarely in their sights.

“Oh, er, perhaps we can discuss this *another time*, Lord Gumigo.” I spoke urgently.

“Ah, yes yes! We shall meet you in the meadows, newrealmer!” 

“Let’s actually see it move, yes!” The smaller gator beamed.

“Yeah, sure, see ya—”

“May I have your attention, please!” Another voice boomed out, this one belonging to Chiska. “All students with personal conveyances may now leave! To all students who have *chartered a river cruise*—” The feline practically *seethed* at that ridiculous comment. A sentiment that I wholeheartedly agreed with after a moment of reflection. “—please line up in an orderly fashion at…” 

*NEIIGHHHH!* Thalmin’s horse reared loudly, the prince once more gesturing at the incoming leopard who had transitioned from a gentle walk to an all-out jog now.

I took this as our sign to leave, hopping on the V4c with a twirl and fluttering Mifis’ GUN travel cloak as I did so.

*I’ve always wanted to do that…*

With another glance towards Thalmin, I took a deep breath as I steadied my hands on both of the V4c’s handlebars. 

**\[All Systems Nominal.\]**

“EVI, give me full manual control.”

**\[Affirmative.\]**

Time slowed to a proverbial crawl now, as my focus shifted towards not just Thalmin, or the encroachment of his ever-eager fanclub. Instead, my eyes were leveled towards the rest of the conveyances that were poised to leave right about as we were. 

Gumigo’s stagecoach, complete with four meticulously carved stone-drake golems, stood idly by as he turned towards me in the ‘driver’ seat high above us, tipping his slouch hat in my general direction. 

Qiv’s carriage, literally your typical *fantasy princess carriage*, stood ominously without the presence of mounts nor drivers, reminding me more of Lord Lartia’s carriage but shrunk down for its modest role in holding just two occupants.

Ping’s carriage, however, stood far larger than either Qiv or Gumigo’s conveyances. Indeed, it was the biggest non-tower vehicle on the lot. A double-deckered, souped-up carriage that was as elegant as your 25th century Martian all-terrain omni-utility vehicle designed for the Martian badlands but destined for the garage of your post-war martian suburbanite.  

I took a deep breath, as without a clear ‘go-ahead’ due to Chiska’s preoccupation with the cruise group, everyone seemed to be waiting on each other to push off the starting line.

My hands trembled as a single bead of sweat poured down my brow.

There was no revving of engines as would be expected. Though there *were* several large bursts of mana radiation, as if that's how they made up for the lack of any physical tells.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 340% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

Gumigo turned excitedly at us, and the rest of our fellow travel companions.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 400% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

Qiv rolled down his window, if only to glower at both of us, and Gumigo’s smaller stagecoach.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 500% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

Ping followed suit, a shit-eating grin and a prolonged snort, showing that the largest burst of mana radiation was clearly analogous to the ‘loudest’ revving of these proverbial magical ‘engines’. 

With no further indications as to who was to start, it was Gumigo’s troupe who was first off the line.

“YA! GO GO GO!” He screamed, sending several solid bursts of mana radiation through those reins and into the golems. 

All four beasts suddenly roared to life, kicking dust and dirt behind them at impressive speeds.  

*KA-THWOMP*

*KA-THWOMP* 

*KA-THWOMP*

Qiv quickly followed, the steel-reinforced wooden wheels of his carriage crackling to life with several bursts of mana radiation.

*WHOOOOSH!*

Then finally, Ping followed suit, a solid *THUD* marking the magical equivalent of an OUV’s start as it completely and utterly smoked Gumigo’s troupe.

However, this was where Thalmin and I finally pushed forwards, the prince giving his horse a firm command as the familiar sounds of a galloping horse finally echoed through the air.

*CLOP*

*CLOP* 

*CLOP*

This was followed close in tow by a familiar high-pitched whine, one louder than any the Nexus had yet seen, as the motor within the V4c could only be rivalled by that of the MOTHERSHIP drone. 

Many amidst the crowd quickly snapped their heads in my direction.

Though only a certain leopard crowd seemed less bothered by that development and more dejected by our sudden departure.

“I’ll see you in the meadows, Prince Havenbrock!” Cynthis called out, waving us… or rather, Thalmin goodbye.

No sooner did those words echo into the distance did I quickly overtake Thalmin, moving forward to smoke Gumigo’s group, before promptly leveling out near Qiv’s carriage. 

However, because this wasn’t yet our challenge, I simply gave the man a nod, prompting the gorn-esque lizard to simply roll up his window in annoyance.

It would, however, be *Ping* that was my ultimate target as I pushed the V4c *harder*, the whirring of the electric motors dominating the otherwise silent air while the speedometer climbed to 90, 100, 120…

I found myself neck to neck with Ping’s mega-carriage at about 150, my smile growing wider and wider as I *toyed* and continued to straddle what felt like the functional limit of his carriage’s speed.

Though, quite unexpectedly, he surprised me as he pushed the large and unwieldy thing to 170 kph, the bull even rolling down his window to give me a dismissive wave as he left me in the dust… 

I waited for a few seconds to see where he was going with this, watching as the carriage peaked at 180, its suspension surprisingly holding out despite the inconsistent bursts of mana radiation it was giving off. 

I took a deep breath, savoring the hunt, before twisting my wrist sharply and pushing the V4c to even greater speeds. 

It took barely a handful of breaths to reach the bull’s window. 

At which point, I saw him wide-eyed, slack-jawed, and utterly *fuming* at the seams.

Though sadly, that sight would be short-lived. As Vicini Lorsi’s cries and frantic scrambles cut our nonverbal exchange short. 

“Lord Ping, we cannot sustain—”

“I WILL DICTATE WHAT WE CAN OR CANNOT DO!” 

A large and unsteady burst of mana radiation followed, causing Ping’s carriage to suddenly lose speed, as I promptly just cruised on, only turning back to wave at the rapidly decelerating carriage with a noble’s wave. 

Sadly, the bull had long since rolled up his window. 

Moreover, he’d now pulled up by the side of the road, eventually being smoked by Qiv’s carriage, Gumigo’s stagecoach, and Thalmin’s horse in that order.

But I could only imagine what sort of faces he was making just behind that pane of magically polarized glass.

=====

**The Crown Herald Town of Elaseer. Outer Wall Ring Road. Local Time 1305 Hours.**

**Emma**

We made surprisingly good headway as we coasted and hugged the outer edges of the town, sticking to paths occupied by the occasional horse and buggy, mule drawn cart, and whatever else *non-magical* conveyance existed in this dastardly dichotomous world between the magical and the *non*\-magical. If anything, the outer edges of town reminded me of the *outer ring service highways* common in old metros — dedicated roads for commercial and industrial traffic but not much else. Which was a good thing, given how Thalmin had hoped to avoid picking up on any unwanted *attention*. 

Though attention was inevitably drawn by virtue of our two conveyances, it was clear the locals’ eyes were drawn more to us as a collective whole rather than the V4c itself; Sorecar’s magical mods clearly having worked out quite well all things considered. 

“You know… I’m not really looking forward to using the transportium.” I admitted, turning to Thalmin before grabbing the pamphlet that Chiska had handed out to us during orientation. 

“I understand the hesitation, Emma. The… *incident* with Mal’tory’s portal would’ve left even the most seasoned chosen one to reassess their faith in portal travel. However, to counter that, I’d like to pose a question — you’ve no doubt experienced Vanavan’s conjured portal back to the Academy, no?”

“Yeah, I did.” 

“Then try focusing on *that* experience rather than Mal’tory’s. The former was an anomalous incident, resulting from both a forced entry into a singleton portal, as well as whatever safeguards Mal’tory had put in place to *ensure* said singleton status. Most portal travel is far less… malicious, and more akin to your experiences with Vanavan’s teleportation magic.” 

“I’ll definitely try, Thalmin. Thanks.” I nodded in acknowledgement, before quickly looking over into the distance at our intended destination.

“The town’s Transportium nexus should be just beyond the Warehouse district. The Western wall’s townguard keep is what we should be on the lookout for.” The prince spoke.

“Right, I’ll keep an eye out for—”

**\[Alert. Anomalous activity detected on external visual sensors. Source: V4c Cam No. 3. TIMESTAMP…** **Incident Start: 12.20.23… Incident End… 12.21.22. Total time elapsed: 59 seconds. Read Annotated Local Security Report?\]**

“Go for it, EVI.” I acknowledged, cutting my words short as I began scrolling through the incident report.

My eyes widened as I realized what I was seeing, prompting me to quickly signal Thalmin to pull over.

The prince, clearly catching wind that *something* had gone awry, dismounted quickly; the both of us distancing ourselves from our vehicles. 

Without any words exchanged, Thalmin quickly deployed a privacy screen, giving me what he’d taught me as the Havenbrockian ‘all clear’ signal — a clenched fist held perpendicular to the sternum.

“What is it, Emma?” He questioned.

“We have a situation.” I spoke as I grabbed hold of my datatab, handing it over to Thalmin. 

The security footage started playing soon after. To the untrained eye, it would seem as if it was a whole 59 seconds of nothing.

Thankfully, both the prince’s intuition and the EVI’s visual analysis algorithms seemed to align at about the same time, as Thalmin preempted the EVI’s annotations highlighting movement towards the rear of the horse armor at about 25 seconds in.

It was barely noticeable, what amounted to a little divot forming to the rear of the armor. One that didn’t exactly conform to the natural bending and flexing of the horse’s own movements, or even the wind.

However, what truly gave it away was the slight and barely noticeable *addition* in the armor’s chainmail — a raised protrusion over a single link of chain mail that was caught in 16k. 

“I should’ve felt something was off.” He chastised himself firmly before moving once more to the horse, poised to do *something* to the armor.

However, before any mana radiation signatures could be detected, he pulled back, shaking his head once more as he let out yet another sigh.

“No. Any detection spells or investigation magic would immediately render our advantage useless.” He began, placing his snout in his hand in contemplative thought.

“I’m assuming we’re dealing with some sort of magical tracker?” I attempted to clarify. “Something probably high-end, given how there were *barely* any hints of it, both visually and magically?”

“It’s, as you say — *high end* — Emma.” Thalmin acknowledged. “So much so that any cursory glances into and around the manastreams result in nothing out of the ordinary being felt.” The lupinor began walking laps around both of our vehicles, his fingers continually scratching the fur beneath his snout. “Either the dean or the goldthorn wishes to track us.” He stated simply. “Either way, the situation remains the same — we are currently in a precarious situation… but we *do* hold the advantage.” 

“They have no idea that we’ve detected it.” 

“Precisely. Thanks to your manaless memory shards, we currently stand one step ahead of them. But where we go from here… is currently up in the air.” Thalmin admitted with a sullen sigh. 

“We could just abandon the horse armor, right? I mean, I get it was an expensive upgrade and whatnot, but—” I stopped myself as the prince eyed me with a knowing gaze.

“Yeah, no, that’s a crap idea. It’d take them a few hours tops to realize something’s gone awry. Afterwhich, they’d just pull some other crap on us or track us the old-fashioned way.” I quickly corrected myself.

“If we are to gain long term reprieve from this chase, we need to find a more permanent solution. One in which we can press our advantage in this shadowy theatre of war.” Thalmin offered. “We need to not only be rid of the tracker, but *use it* to our advantage.” 

“We need to go full MILDEC, huh?” I replied bluntly. “Right, okay, hm… selling or putting the horse armor on another horse wouldn’t really work.”

“No, it wouldn’t.” Thalmin replied bluntly.

“Sending the horse away wouldn’t really work too since they’d just be onto us in a heartbeat.”

“Correct.” The prince nodded.

“We need some place to dispose of the horse armor.” I began.

“Some means to keep it moving on a similar enough path as the rest of the other peer groups.” Thalmin added.

“At roughly the same pace and speed too.” I added.

“In order to maintain the guise of plausibility to lead them off our trail.” Thalmin concluded.

The both of us fell into silence, kicking up dirt and grass as we did so before a lightbulb moment hit us.

At which point, we quickly turned to face each other, Thalmin shooting me a knowing gaze which I unfortunately could not reciprocate.

“A place where we may either *entrap* our pursuer—” I began.

“—or keep them constantly on the run.” Thalmin concluded. 

“*The river cruise*.” We both spoke at the same time with wide toothy grins.

We moved to close the gap with a solid high-five, eventually resulting in us gripping each other’s hands, before slamming both of them close to our chests; celebrating the synergy of our shared goober tactics.

With no time to lose, we quickly hopped on our mounts, setting off for a district we’d passed by on several occasions but had yet to truly explore — the riverfront ports.

“So… how do you propose we actually *get on* the cruise? Let alone lose whoever’s following us on the ship? I mean, you saw how he was completely *invisible* on my cameras and sensors.” I asked, as the unfortunate *logistics* of the otherwise sound and solid plan started rearing its ugly head.

“Our pursuer is probably using the same cloak of invisibility as Ilunor did in the workshop.” Thalmin offered. “This makes it difficult if not impossible to truly spot them. However, our plan isn’t contingent on actually *finding* the pursuer. Ours is a feint, a ruse, a diversion tactic after all. We simply need to remain on the boat for as long as possible before departing at the last minute. Whether they get on or remain on shore is irrelevant. We’d have trapped them in the former scenario, or will be sending them on a wild cowvern chase in the latter. Forcing them to desperately follow a ship on land.”

“Right.” I acknowledged with a nod. “So our real concern is in getting on the boat, and exiting right at the eleventh hour.”

“Correct, Emma.” 

“Alright… Well then, I hope you have your coin pouch open, Thalmin. I’ll be sure to pay you back when we get back.”

=====

**The Crown Herald Town of Elaseer. Riverfront. Dock 3. Local Time 1345 Hours.**

**Emma**

There was a healthy flurry of activity at the docks. With carts hauling fresh produce and canvas-covered tarps, to gentrified versions of the stalls I saw over at common-town, hawking overpriced wares ranging from ‘authentic’ souvenirs from far-off lands to freshly-cooked and magically-infused treats that just *screamed* overpriced. 

“Daisy’s Doughy Delights! Get your airy cloud puffs! Get your angel strudels! All baked by the hearth of a genuine fire elemental from the western lavalands!” A particularly thin elf shouted from one of the stalls, his voice intermingling with a hundred other vendors that cried out for attention from a tough and frankly disinterested crowd.

A crowd consisting of dock workers and town officials, to the merchants and nobles that stood leagues above them in fashion and dress.

It was… honestly a bit jarring to see the dichotomy here. 

Other parts of town hid it much better, but here? You could really start to see the class disparity. Or at least, the disparity that existed between the *necessary* ‘middling’ class, and those of noble blood.

The working classes seemed to be sequestered somewhere hidden, probably in the warehouse district.

Whatever the case was, I didn’t allow the flurry of distractions to get the best of me, as Thalmin and I pushed forwards down the vehicle-friendly road towards a particularly large riverboat. A boat which immediately became my next object of interest, as my eyes settled on the two large outriggers that kept it a fair distance away from the actual port itself. 

“A trimaran?” I questioned, turning to Thalmin as he nodded.

“Those two outriggers you see act similarly to the wings of an aethraship. They’re advanced artifices, capable of propelling the boat through water using a series of complex enchantments, spells, and whatnot. All commanded by either a carefully organized crew of chosen ones, or some mage of some sort.” Thalmin explained, prompting me to simply let out an ‘ahh’ as we made our way closer towards the boat and its docking boom. 

The whole length of the craft spanned two entire designated docks, reaching about three-hundred or so feet from bow to stern. 

This relatively large size compared to both passengers and cargo granted some clemency in terms of portside congestion. 

Though this also meant the passengers, crew, and staff were quick to pick up on our arrival. 

Two figures ended up meeting us halfway from the ship, one of whom was an elf donning more or less what I’d expected of a Venetian ship captain and the other being a student that was unfortunately on shaky terms with our group… and me in particular.

“Ahem.” The tortle-like-turtle cleared his throat, crossing his arms as he glared daggers in my direction. “What do you think you are doing here, *newrealmer*?” He seethed.

“You appear to *not* be on our passenger manifest, nor our leasing contract…” The boat captain quickly added, scrolling through his elongated scroll in the process. 

“There’s been a change of plans, Lord Ysiv.” Thalmin spoke on my behalf, bowing halfway as he did so. “If you would be so kind, we request passage aboard this vessel.” The prince paused, before gesturing towards the V4c. “There’s been… certain magical limitations when it comes to Cadet Emma Booker’s conveyance. We wish for a more *convenient* passage as a result, in order to—”

“Such is *typical* for an uppity newrealmer desperate to make itself known.” Ysiv acknowledged with a snarky jab, prompting me to do everything in my power *not* to strike him down where he stood.

“There is no need for such language Lord Ysiv.” Thalmin rebutted, his fangs bearing ever so slightly. 

“Oh? Is that so? And what are you to do about it, mercenary prince? Just to reiterate your *position* in the current hierarchy, you are currently playing the role of the *beggar*. And last I checked? *Beggars cannot be choosers*. Not with gold, not with services, and most certainly not with *requests*.” The tortle-like-tortoise rambled out slowly, methodically, clearly enjoying this ‘dressing down’ of the prince. “So what say you, oh usurper prince? Do you wish to contest your betters, or do you wish to—”

Thalmin quickly turned his back on the tortle-like tortoise, cutting him off before ignoring him entirely. 

A quick glance towards me was enough to convey his stance on the matter, as unlike Ilunor or even Thacea, the prince had zero tolerance and no stomach for *noble discourse*.

“I was not finished with you!” Ysiv screamed out, but to no avail.

Once we were out of earshot and under a fresh new privacy screen, did Thalmin finally speak.

“I have acted brashly, Emma. For that, I apologize.” He apologized. “However, I could not stand by and allow that impetuous creature to sully *both* of our names. Even if it *is* for ‘passage’ on that vessel. I’d rather we face down this spy than to have my honor besmirched for the sake of *convenience*.” 

“It’s alright, Thalmin. I appreciate your integrity there.” I replied reassuringly. “We’ll regroup and reevaluate our plan of action. I’m sure there’s—”

“Ahem.” Another voice suddenly interrupted us from behind, *just* outside of our cone of silence. “I apologize if I’m intruding in this private conversation, but I overheard your earlier arguments with our dear, old *cruise coordinator*.” The orange haired elf spoke casually, almost *too* casually. 

**\[A80 Lord Favril Etale\]**

The name was familiar, as with most names in the student body. In fact, the man’s presence as one of the few elves in the year group *did* make him stand out some more.

But then again, given our limited contact, that was about just as much as I recognized of him.

“I do apologize for the adjacent realmer’s rather *uncouth* decorum. He acts so far beyond his years as is typical of his kind.” Etale chuckled through a polite grin. “In any case, I know you are a knight of action, earthrealmer. As much as your grandiose and web-weaving speeches seem to indicate otherwise.” He once more chuckled at his jokes, shaking his head all the while. “I wish to aid you in your request, to offer you a room aboard our little cruise. Both you and your Havenbrockian partner, of course.” 

I blinked in response, cocking my head as a result. His tone was… difficult to pin down. On one hand, it felt awfully less condescending than the tortle-like tortoise. But on the other hand, there was *something* hidden there beneath the excitable and agreeable persona that I just couldn’t pin down.

“What’s the catch?” Thalmin quickly chimed in, taking the words right out of my mouth.

“Ah, there it is.” The elf raised a finger. “*The catch*. There’s *always* a catch to anything with my kind, hmm?” He spoke slyly. “But yes, you would be wise to ask that. Indeed, my *catch*, as it were, is that you must *earn* this passage.” 

Those latter words didn’t sit right with me, nor Thalmin for that matter. 

But before any of us could interject, another elf quickly walked up to stand beside him.

**\[A81 Lady Lesaine Evrail\]**

“Oh just get to the point already, Lord Etale. The ship departs in just over two hours!” The white-haired elf woman spoke, before turning towards me with an expectant grin. 

“*Earn your passage*, what an ominous thing to say.” Evrail sighed, shaking her head with an exasperated breath. “Simply put, earthrealmer, we offer you a challenge. We’ve seen how you have fared in the realm of physical activity, but we are curious as to your more *intellectual pursuits*. In short, we wish to challenge you to a duel. A single round of our favorite game…” 

“Lines of Succession **\[Remastered\]**.” They both spoke simultaneously. 

Everything quickly clicked into place following that demand, my mind immediately recalling exactly who these two were… *two of the table-top RTS gamers in the third nook of the student lounge…*

“We offer a simple lightning round, concurrent turns, and a full ten-thousand point limit.” Lady Evrail continued. 

“That’s *full unit and logistics points* too. If you truly do hail from as advanced a civilization as you claim, then you should have *no problems* in demonstrating your abilities to conduct *contemporary warfare*, yes?” Lord Etale quickly added, as both elves grinned like jackals waiting for their next easy meal.

“Well, what do you say, earthrelamer? Do we have a deal?” 

I couldn’t help but to grin internally, excitement quickly overtaking me.

*You two don’t know what’s coming…* I quickly thought to myself. *All those hours on Era of Kingdoms are finally going to pay off.*

“Yeah. You’ve got yourselves a deal.” I acknowledged with a handshake.

Still, they most certainly made quite the impression right off the starting line! We'll have to see if their gambit pans out however, but suffice it to say, what happens next will be quite interesting haha! :D Or so I hope! :D I really do hope you guys enjoy the chapter! :D **The next Two Chapters are already up on Patreon if you guys are interested in getting early access to future chapters.**)

Thanks for the chapter!

Man, reminded that they think newrealmer often haven’t even explored their full world, the shock to the average student of Earth is going to be on the big side. 
But Gummigoo and co seem prime for a peoper introdution to things manaless. 
Do hope everyone is made to apologize for all this rudeness eventually. 


Tracker noted and simple disposal adventure had.

And if Emma has alreayd played that Age of Empires reference, EVI should easy be able to assimilate the rules, play it to superhuman skill, ans give Emma recommendations. Really make the knife ears here loos bad.

Damn, my streak of one comment per chapter on release is broken, because I somehow missed last week's chapter. Curse you, movement based vision and/or reddit layout!

Soon, Emma shall be known by yet another name, LegendOfLinesOfSuccession, or maybe she will start a brochure called "EnormousEmmaEntertainment" for all Nexian RTS enthusiasts ... we will see.

I think she'll use EVI as a predictive engine while she guides primary strategy. 2 v 1 shifts to 2 v 2. EVI can also provide her the cognitive power to know all the individual models. They also don't state that she has to win, only play. True gamers, looking to play at any opportunity.

No mana required to hit those speeds. Makes you wonder what the actual manual or the one-shots say about capabilities. I love that she used her opponents pride to damage themselves.

I loved the vehicle collector utilizing a guidebook catalog to determine what she was riding. Yes. If she had to design it herself and then fabricate it, she couldn't have. As always she's leveraging millennia of tech improvements and iterative development to counterbalance the weakness of a new realm in an informational vacuum. I assembled it is a more exact phrasing for what she did, but colloquially it's understood with I built it.

The weakness of invisibility makes itself shown, because any interaction reveals presence. And yes, an increase of 1/16 of a single link would be ignored to all but the most hypervigilant. Good thing EVI has an almost perfect attention span.

The "I'm not done with you!" made me laugh, since the interaction only continues if the beggar is still begging. Once the petition is removed, there is no power to be displayed.

EDIT 3: have removed the comparison to other professions.

EDIT 4: When Doug Ford needed physicians to run the covid assessment centres during the peak of the pandemic - when walk in clinics were closed, and they wanted to avoid the burden on the Emergency department and hospital - they were able to provide $160/hr rate during regular work days, and $220/hr rate for weekend, evening work. Overhead was completely covered (building, staff, supplies, EMR/paper chart), including personal protective equipment - all doctors had to do was show up and do the medicine. None of those shifts went uncovered, instead there were waiting lists to sign up for those shifts. If family medicine was set up in Ontario like that ... everyone in Ontario could have a family doctor.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

I finished family medicine residency in 2020 in the middle of the pandemic. Moved to provide locum coverage in a small town. After locum work dried up, I decided to figure out next steps.

There are 4000+ orphan pts - pts without family doctors in my community. I have availability to provide care to some of these people but I cannot. Why not? Because the govt is funding us 38% of what is required to provide proper family medicine care.

The current existing group based clinics in this small town are ALL FULL. i.e. there's no physical space for me to join them as a new doctor. So, then I have to start fresh.

Ok so what does it mean?

What this means -is BEFORE I even see the first patient - I need to have paid for a lease for the building, hired and paid for staff, paid for the Electronic Medical Record set up, paid for the utilities for the building, paid for the supplies to run the office, paid for computers to run the office, paid for the photocopier, fax etc.

I am in debt from school, I would have to take-on more debt to pay for all of the above. It costs **$84,000-$100,000 / year** to run a family doctor's office PER doctor. Even in group practices EACH doctor has $7,500-9,000/mth that they have to pay towards the GROUP overhead.

Next, I actually then see the pt in consultation for their:

1. blood pressure review ----------- -------- bill OHIP $37.95
2. knee arthritis review ------------- --------  bill OHIP $0
3. mole on back review ------------- -------    bill OHIP $0
4. parking permit disability form sign --- bill OHIP $0

**2023** $$ **- The Actual cost + value to provide this service:**        **$ 98.67**

**2023** $$ **-** **Total payment by OHIP:**                                                   **$ 37.95**

**--------------------------------------**

2023 - (Health care subsidized by your doctor) **FUNDING GAP:   $60.72**

&#x200B;

Out of the $37.95 from OHIP- after paying 35% overhead,  I am left with $24.67.

Out of that $24.67  I have to also self-fund:

* Sick leave support
* Short and long term Disability benefits
* Retirement Pension Plan
* 1-year Maternity leave

I get no:

* Vacation pay. ***Instead I have to pay someone to cover me when I am on vacation or I get no coverage, and come back from vacation/conference to have a bunch of patient complaints about how I left the office without coverage.***
* Overtime pay
* Statutory Holiday Pay

If I were to have a full family practice I would have an additional **20hrs/wk** of unpaid paperwork that I would have to wade through.

Small business owners like  your mechanic, your chiropractor, your dentist, your naturopath, your massage therapist can all increase their fees/rates to manage higher overhead.   **By Law - Doctors CANNOT** do this.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Some will counter, with why don't I join the "FHO" model - where doctors get a fixed amount per pt / year?

Well let's see how that model plays out and do the math step by step:

Based on patient sex and age, a certain amount is **paid per year** (full breakdown: [https://stewartmedicine.com/emr-consulting/fho-model-payments/](https://stewartmedicine.com/emr-consulting/fho-model-payments/)) . E.g.

14 Y old teenage girl - $80/yr +($12 access bonus if she never goes to a Walk-in in the whole year)

14 Y old teenage boy - $70/yr +($11.88 access bonus if he never goes to a Walk-in in the whole year)

60 Y old woman - $260/yr + ($40 access bonus if no walk in clinic use the whole year)

60 Y old man - $220/yr + ($34 access bonus if no WIC use the whole year)

Avg for male pts - $220, avg for female pts - $270. But this is skewed because most panels are not full of 70-90 year olds, they have a full spectrum of ages. (Access bonus not included in avgs, because it's not guaranteed - more on this below)

In an **AVERAGE** patient panel - it would be $220-$230/pt/yr.  That means there are doctors (newer doctors/early career ones) with younger patients who earn **LESS** than the avg - closer to $180-$200/pt/yr avg, and older docs with older patients who earn MORE $250-$270/pt/yr avg

This means an average sized roster \~1200 pts --> 276,000 /yr

In this size roster - shadow billings monthly (happen when the patient actually comes to see the doctor in person or has a phone visit, shadow billings have been 15% for 2 decades, recently increased to 19%)  would give an additional approx. $3,200 monthly -->$ 38,400 /yr

Monthly income ends up being $17,030 after accounting for 35% overhead.  If you divide this by the hours that the physician worked to provide care to a 1200 roster- easily 50+hrs/wk - including paperwork and seeing patients x 4 weeks/mth --> 200hrs/ mth --> **$85.15 hourly rate (not takehome, it's PRE-TAX which can be 33-41% marginal rate).**

While this rate is definitely higher than minimum wage, and average hourly rates of the general population- consider physicians have put in long years and extensive money in training and have to self-fund all of the below from their hrly rate:

* Sick leave support
* Short and long term Disability benefits
* Retirement Pension Plan
* 1-year Maternity leave

Now if the above isn't enough, the MOH has it set up so that certain basic codes are fully negated (i.e. the MOH takes money **out of the family doctor's pocket** and puts it into the pocket of the doctor that patients see when the patient seeks care elsewhere- walk in clinic, or at the hospital -e.g. a laceration repair in the emergency dept done by a family doctor, or getting a chemotherapy infusion in the hospital.

Another reason none of the FHOs in my town want to take on another doctor (even if they could squeeze me into their limited space) -  **Because it would increase their burden of after hours -evening and weekend clinics that they would have to provide because they have more doctors.** If your boss came up to you and said, "I want to hire Bob, he's a good guy, and knows what he's doing, but if I hire him, it means all of us will have to do an extra mandatory evening of work, and an extra mandatory weekend of work" - **HOW MANY OF YOU WOULD TAKE UP THAT OFFER at your job** or would you vote to not have Bob join?

&#x200B;

The above is a failed business model - whether fee for service or certain parts of the FHO system also. This is why despite there being ample need in my small town community, and my availability and expertise in family medicine I am not doing office based family medicine right now. I do small procedural work, earn 30-40% less than my actual full earning capacity if I was working within my full scope and full time.  **There is no value placed by the govt on the good care that I know how to provide to my patients.**  I am unable to charge patients directly for this good care.

The govt is giving away pieces of the pie to pharmacists, nurses - they can keep doing this. All that it means, is more people will present to the emergency dept with bladder ca diagnosis (misdiagnosed as UTI and treated repeatedly by pharmacists), or with pancreatic ca diagnosis (misdiagnosed as heartburn and treated with nexium repeatedly), or with locally advanced skin ca (misdiagnosed as eczema and treated with topical cortisone cream repeatedly to no avail) among many many many other examples of the same that we have all come across. **People will suffer due to government actions and legislations**. It is abundantly clear, that these new legislations have come in the face of the commercialization and privatization of medicine. Shoppers, Loblaws are all in bed with the govt.

My colleagues are working 6-10 walk in clinic shifts/mth. Others are doing 10-12 emergency dept shifts/mth. Others are just doing inpatient hospitalist medicine 1wk/ mth. Others still are doing private pay telemedicine etc, or cosmetic - botox, filler work. **Only small fractions of each graduating residency trained Family medicine program are setting up an office based practice.**

If the public wants family doctors to keep doing office based family medicine, and newly trained family medicine graduates to actually do office based family medicine - then they need to **WAKE UP** and support our ask to the govt to improve funding from these historic lows.

This is why the Ontario Union of Family Physicians was created - out of a serious desire to  raise awareness re the **sustainability crisis faced by family physicians** and the **negative impact on health this will have for all Ontarians** if we don't act now. [oufp.ca](https://oufp.ca)

&#x200B;

Ontarians - **LISTEN UP -** despite what the govt says - **we have ENOUGH trained family doctors RIGHT NOW** \- **today**, and have never had more per capita than right now in 2023. However, the business model needs to improve if you want family doctors to open up office based practice again, or better yet, not close the existing ones which people are planning on shuttering as part of their 3-5 year plans.

Thanks so much for providing the numbers of how the billing works. My family doctor has me on a roster now and I assumed it was a much higher annual amount. I'm 38 but have a lot of health issues, especially after covid. I guess under this model, my doctor gets penalized for that. I signed the petition but I have little hope this government will do the right thing. Thank you for spreading the word.

I posted my response in the ["Disappearing Doctors"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ottawa/comments/17pua91/disappearing_doctors/) thread in r/ottawa last night about my opinion as to why I would leave family medicine.   


>The flock is going on with doctors in Ottawa? Has anyone heard of this happening, here or in other cities? Are they just crushed by the increase in work, no increase in salary, and the knowledge that nothing is going to change any time soon?

I am a family doctor in Ottawa who does longitudinal family medicine. I also have experience setting up and running a clinic as well. I would say there is a 50% chance that I will close my practice in 3 years. It's actually too bad because I enjoy the medicine part of family medicine and the relationships you build through time. I would feel bad if my patients became orphaned. I will have a better view on my decision depending on the outcome of the physician services agreement in March 2024. Why?  
  
The business model is broken. Top line revenue is stagnant (I actually billed 5% less this year than last year), and expenses have gone up dramatically. I don't know if people know how expensive it is to set up a clinic in this city. There is also no funding for this. There is no legal, accounting or administrative support.  
  
The way the practice of comprehensive medicine is remunerated is broken. Do you know that I can assess diagnose and treat ADHD? I do so quite often too. On a fee-for-service model, OHIP will pay $140.20 for 1 hour of this type of assessment (2 x K005), then 37$ per follow-up. Or you can go to talkwithFrida and pay 599$ for 75 mins and 79$ per follow-up appointment. I give patients the exact same forms as they do. It's just that I am also not paid to review the forms. I also have a much wider scope and will treat your comorbid depression, anxiety, PTSD, substance use disorder, manage your transgender care etc, whereas they will not. In a capitation model, it is not much better. If you are a 25 year old male who never negates me with walk ins, OHIP will pay me $100.20 per year. If I do an ADHD assessment it's 19% of the fee for service code = $26.60. Then let's say later I drain that abscess on your butt cheek instead of having you wait 12 hours in ER? That's 63.9\*19% = $12.14 - as much as a Shawarma combo. Everything pays the same, despite the number of issues you deal with in an encounter, the complexity, or whatever you end up saving the healthcare system downstream.  
  
Administrative burden. I'm not just talking about labs. There are always labs, reports and insurance forms. It is the administrative dumping from other services in this city. Bariatrics for example makes us order a set of bloodwork before they see the patient. They could just as easily directly ask the patient to do it and follow up on the results themselves. They are funded by the gov to have staff to do this yet they send it back to us to do. I am not even certain they read the bloodwork I send them. OCEAN eReferrals is another issue. There are a number of EMRs that do not integrate with OCEAN. However some organizations, like psychiatry at QCH will only accept referrals through OCEAN. It takes about 15 mins to manually copy and paste all the info and write the referral through their system. These are just a few examples of admin burden that exist in this city.  
  
We are seen as being responsible for the whole system. Can't get in to see breast cancer clinic? long wait times with derm? psych? orthopedic surgeon? patients blame it on us, and I have had some ask me to 'put in a good word' with the surgeon to help them jump the knee replacement waitlist. It does not work that way. I do not control the wait time for the entire health care system. Each department has its own triage list with varying length and ability to communicate with patients their position on the waitlist.  
  
So what do I want to see? 1) Help fund the creation and upkeep of family medicine clinics. 2) Reward comprehensive family medicine that encourages complexity and multi-issue problems instead of pumping volumes of patients to make money. 3) Stop admin dumping. 4) Get a central referral system in Ottawa for ALL referral services. That way patients can make inquiries about their status directly.  
  
I would like to continue working comprehensive family medicine for the next 20 years, but this trajectory is unsustainable. It does not matter how many medical students, residents or IMGs you can produce or hire here. If downstream you can not retain family doctors in family practice, then the system will collapse.

UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM

AITA?
Let’s start from the beginning. My husband (34M) and I (31F) have the only grandchild on his side of the family. His mom (my MIL) has always been A LOT. From crying the day before our wedding, to saying crap like I’m just not warm and fuzzy enough for her. I have tried my best to be as welcoming as possible and bend over backwards for this women. Tension definitely increased when they decided to move states and bought a house 10 minutes from us. 

My son (3.5M), is the center of his Grandma’s universe. It use to be my husband (complained for years that he abandoned her when he moved out). And to be fair to her, she has been incredibly helpful with my son (taking to doctors’ appointments, helping out when he gets sick, watching our dog when he is in the hospital, & so on). My son has an immunocompromised system that comes with a lot of health issues. Receives infusion monthly and so on. 

Well, my MIL has HSV (Herpes Simplex Virus) or more commonly known as fever blisters/cold sores. We (my husband and I) have had over 8 different chats with my MIL that she is not to have her mouth anywhere near my son’s skin (no kissing, sharing straws, utensils, ETC). She has broken this rule MULTIPLE times, too many to count. Each time, met with another chat from my husband and I. 

Fast forward to 3weeks ago, she comes over with an active open cold sore and gives him a raspberry on the cheek. I immediately said something, but sure enough….3 days later my son wakes up inconsolable and complaining of lip pain. In the next 2 days it was very clear he now has HSV. We got testing with his specialist he sees, and yup….it’s HSV. Now I am no dummy, I know 60% of the population has it and he could have gotten it later in life from a friend or such, BUT that isn’t what happened. He got it in a COMPLETELY avoidable way. Not to mention, for those that are immunocompromised the sores tend to be worse, more painful, and can cause serious health complications.

So we tell my MIL in a non angry way, but explained what happened and that we need some space. The next day she shows up unannounced at our house while my husband is working from home and lets herself in. Demands to speak to him (he was in a meeting) and first off refuses to take any responsibility. Says she “kissed him on the neck,” and couldn’t possibly be her fault. Meanwhile, I witnessed the whole thing happen, and it wasn’t his neck (& even if it was his neck, we said no mouth on his skin). Well, my husband calmly tells her to leave because he is working and that we aren’t ready to talk to her. 

I am just heart broken for my son. Just another medical thing to add to his plate. More labs are now needed to monitor his organs for the rest of forever. He will have to deal with outbreaks throughout his whole life. Just everything that comes with HSV. 

Here comes the AITA. 
AITA for wanting to completely cut ties with my MIL and just focus on my little wonderful family I have? I am tired of her passive aggressive behavior. And this was just reckless and selfish to be honest. She has been incredibly helpful, BUT that does not excuse this behavior or allow her to put my son’s health in jeopardy. She was told so many times, and she chose to act selfishly…SOO many times. Just this time, her luck ran out. 


TL;DR: AITA for wanting to be done with my MIL who gave my immunocompromised toddler herpes by kissing him while having an active cold sore. 





UPDATE:
I really appreciate all the feedback. And I do completely agree I have some fault to claim for allowing the same thing to happen and only having verbal consequences/restating the rules. It’s something I will carry with me. 

We have struggled without the extra help. Had to work with him at home on days he is sick and I have had to take off work on several occasions to make doctors appointments (on top of all his other appointments that are planned). We basically have 0 PTO left. But we are figuring it out the best we can.

My husband has received several texts from MIL basically saying poor me, let me see my Grandchild. 

So far Father In Law showed up last month yelling at my husband saying “you don’t understand what this is doing to my MIL” & “we don’t even know why we moved here” He then hinted at the fact that it was all my fault, and my husband very firmly shut him down and then he stormed off. 

& Then today, MIL shows up unannounced and tries to get into the house (we changed the code). My husband texts her and says he is working and has asked for space. She basically says she doesn’t even know who he is anymore and disappointed etc. She then proceeded to call him several times and waited outside our house for 30minutes until finally leaving.

I am so happy we changed the door code. Strangely enough, my son has not once asked about his missing grandparents. We are honestly the ones struggling with our village no longer being there, but he hasn’t seemed to notice at all. 

We are at a loss. This has kinda shaken us & we are just emotionally exhausted. The guilt I feel is overwhelming. I know I am in the right, but it just feels so unnatural and it’s killing me. I hate this whole situation, and they just keep giving us more reasons to not re-initiate contact. But, yeah…that’s all I have for now. 

PS: If you haven’t seen KPOP Demon Hunters, you should. It’s helped me keep my sanity haha.

NTA. She will never stop pushing boundaries and will never stop undermining your rules as your sons parents. Also she is incredibly dense if she truly thinks giving someone a Rasberry when you have an active HSV breakout on your lip won't give them herpes. You can literally get herpes anywhere, people get it on their fingers! She's a selfish idiot, keep her away from your son.

Why is she letting herself in? I mean really? Where are your boundaries about protecting your son! You are allowing this woman to run all over you because you are not ENFORCING any boundaries. Change the damn door lock. Tell her no means no!
```

**Comment #3** by u/Necessary_Dark_6720 (224 points, 2025-07-23 15:41):
```
Why did you continue to allow access to your son after the first multiple times she ignored your rule?

NTA for the reaction now but it's kinda too little too late. You refused to do the hard work of boundaries when you still could (and I mean actually enforcing them -restricting her access, not allowing her to even hold them if she has a cold sore, periods of no contact when she breaks the boundary, etc) and now it's too late and your son has this forever

I would personally never be able to forgive her but I also doubt I would've let it happen so many times

NTA for finally setting boundaries and distancing yourself from that woman. 

YTA and so is your husband for allowing this to happen to your son. You saw this woman break every boundary and rule INCLUDING kissing your son previously and did nothing. And now- your son has to live with HSV bc his parents can’t tell grandma no. Your husband’s balls need to drop asap and stand up for his family.
```

**Comment #5** by u/ChimoEngr (111 points, 2025-07-23 16:57):
```
YTA for not cutting her off sooner. Sure, she helps out, but you must have known that ignoring all her boundary crossing would have consequences eventually.

*For the want of a nail, a Kingdom was lost* \- Terran saying, Age of Chivalry

At 1.33 meters, Hetmwit was a Pagrik of unremarkable size, with brown colored fur that blended in with others of his kind in an unremarkable way. His eyes were wide and brown, showing neither advanced intelligence or abject stupidity. His ears, at the back of his head and lifted slightly, were neither too droopy nor too stiff. His legs and arms were neither too muscular nor too slender. Up until recently, he was unremarkable in word or deed.

That was then.

He was still of unremarkable size and coloring, but his wide brown eyes had a grim purpose shining from them. His jaw was firm and clenched. His body language was of someone expecting violence to erupt at every second.

His appearance sometimes made his mother cry quietly in her room after he left, even though he did not understand why.

Now he sat in a crash cradle on the bridge of the CSFNV *Little Nell Columbia*, a Confederate frigate, watching the robots do their work. He had programmed them himself from common use libraries, but something about the last week had changed them.

They no longer had the T-shaped head that Olipnat Concordiant robots universally possessed, but rather they all looked like Terran skulls. Shipboard crew had a brushstroke of white paint across the eyes and from the top of the skull down across the nose that ended at the bottom jaw. Their teeth were white, set in black warsteel. The Marines had red stripes. They also answered to names and had their own slight personalities that were slowly emerging and becoming more complex.

Normally, Hetmwit would have taken the robots in for maintenance, maybe even wiped their memory cores and reloaded the OEM software packages.

After the last few months, the last few weeks, the fact the robots had changed felt right.

"Reentering realspace under stealth," Mister Smiley, the robot at the navigation station called out.

"Civilian passengers secured, Captain," Mister Donald stated from his station. The robot had an odd scratching/static audio defect in his voice synthesizer that Hetmwit hadn't bothered tracking down.

"All hands, prepare for realspace entry," Captain Decker ordered from the Captain's chair.

The numbers appeared, rapidly dropping.

The entry into realspace was smooth, almost unnoticeable.

"Data coming in," Mister Goofy, another robot, stated from the console. The robot looked up. "System is under heavy attack."

"Put the data onscreen," Captain Decker said.

Hetmwit hit the release catch and stood up, moving to the holotank.

There were two planets in the Terran Green Zone, two in the amber, two in the Red Zone, and four gas giants.

The gas giants were already burning.

The ships orbiting the two Green Zone planets were raining fire on the surface.

The star was an odd fiery reddish-yellow color.

"Hellspace energies detected from the stellar mass," Mister Goofy stated, he looked up from his board again. "System stellar mass has already been hellspiked. There will be a Hellspace corona ignition event within the next seventy-two hours."

"We're too late," Hetmwit said.

Captain Decken nodded, stepping up next to Hetmwit.

"Do we know the population of the system prior to our arrival?" Decken asked. He gripped the endosteel faux-chrome railing and squeezed.

*you failed them you failed us you failed us all* whispered from behind him, audible only to him.

Mister Willy looked up from his console. "Putting data up now."

The windows bloomed next to the burning planets.

**POPULATION: ZERO**

Decken frowned. "These are marked as Terran worlds."

"Reclassified as 'Terran Tomb Worlds' thirty eight thousand years ago," Mister Willy said. "They are marked as both inhabited and uninhabited as well as off limits."

Decken frowned. "That's... weird."

Hetmwit stared at it as the overlapping plasma waves rippled outward, slowly touching one another.

"Enemy ships are withdrawing," Mister Goofy stated. "Planets are at full glassing. Atmosphere has either burnt away or has become toxic."

Decken paced back and forth for a moment before stopping. "Do we have data on which systems are occupied by Terrans nearby?"

Mister Willy consulted his screen. "By cartography and astrography, the nearest stellar system is three point two light years away. However, by population metrics," he paused for a moment before looking back up. "No planets or stellar systems found."

Decken looked at Hetmwit. "Suggestions, Number One?"

Hetmwit looked at the holotank, moving the status of the system into a small box and bringing up the starmap. He colored the Terran Tomb Worlds one color, the Confederate systems another, his own Olipnat Concordiant another color, then the known un-allied multi-stellar nations in other colors.

Finally, he filled in the known attacks.

He stepped back, looking at it, then slowly walked around it.

"We only know of two attacks, three counting this one," he said. "Not enough to gain a full pattern, but it has suggestions."

"What?" Decken asked. "We need more data."

Decken turned to the robots. "Stay in maximum stealth. Passive sensors only. Let's see what happens after the stellar coronal eruption."

\-----

Hetmwit sat in his crash couch, which had converted to a chair, watching the holotank. The time estimates were winding down.

He knew his mother, sisters, and the littles were all as comfortable as he could make them. He had been startled to find out that the staterooms they were in were armored, capable of their own life support with SAR beacons.

If the ship broke up, they acted as small life-pods.

Still, he was worried as he watched the counter move down.

"Stellar coronal eruption occurring... now," Mister Goofy stated.

The star went dark fiery red, swirling with black and purple. It seemed to contract slightly, then a bright flash filled the screen. The ship shook, the sounds of timber creaking and sails flapping on the edge of his hearing.

"Blast wave is consistent with a hellcore detonation. Detonation particle wave and hellspace energies is moving at twelve-hundred times the speed of light in realspace," Mister Goofy stated. "Grav lensing detected."

Hetmwit leaned forward.

"Grav lensing is stable," Mister Goofy said. "Sensor clearing."

Hetmwit undid the harness and got up, moving to the maps hanging in the holotank.

"Running angles on grav lensing," Mister Goofy stated. "Lens origin is approximately twenty million kilometers from stellar mass photosphere. Computing angles."

The star had twelve lenses around it.

"Central creation mass is confirmed to be generating hellspace energies. Stellar mass is core contaminated," Mister Goofy stated.

"It will take nearly a 100,000 years for that energy to reach the photosphere," Captain Decken said, stepping up next to Hetmwit. "Odd thing to do."

"Incoming hellspace energies," Mister Goofy called out. "Hellspace energies are connecting to grav lenses two, seven, nine, eleven. Computing origin points."

All of the grav-lenses were now marked as actively moving energy.

"They must be coming from a stellar mass modified like this one," Decken mused.

"Angles computed," Mister Goofy said. "Relaying data."

Two incoming and three outgoing were connected to worlds in the Olipnat Concordiant, including the system that Hetmwit had first seen Hellspiked.

"Put visible lines between the connected systems," Hetmwit said.

The lines appeared.

"Hyperspace and jumpspace distortions detected," Mister Goofy stated.

"Effects of the distortion?" Captain Decken asked.

"Gravity shadow emitted into jumpspace and hyperspace. No effect on realspace. Effect is detected within five hundred thousand kilometers of the lens," Mister Goofy said.

Hetmwit slowly walked around the tank and back to next to Captain Decken.

He knew what it was.

"Mister Goofy, is this distortion consistent along the energy lines?" he asked.

"Affirmative, sir," Mister Goofy said.

"Estimate distance of the distortion along the lines and highlight the volume of space effected," Hetmwit stated.

"Complying," Mister Goofy said.

"What do you see, Number One?" Captain Decken asked.

The highlight expanded from the lines.

"Current is placed. Estimated distortion distance after one hundred twenty hours is in lower opacity," Mister Goofy stated.

The lines connected, jumping from stellar system to stellar system, each system connected to the nearest stellar masses.

The highlighting slowly filled in the gaps between the lines.

Hetmwit looked up. "It's a barrier."

He touched it.

"Cutting the Galactic Arm Spur in half."

\-----

"We can get out," Captain Decken said, sitting across from Hetmwit at the table in the mess. "Probes show that the distortion fades away enough in the upper bands that the *Nell* can reach."

"The bands everyone *knows* are impossible to travel without dissolving into particles," Hetmwit stated.

Decken nodded.

"Where do you plan on going?" Hetmwit asked.

"Estimating the direction and thickness of the 'fence' as you labeled it, it will use approximately twenty of the Olipnat Concordiant stellar systems," Captain Decken said. "Your people were attacked just because they were in the way."

Hetmwit still felt sick to his stomach, remembering the carnage, but he nodded anyway.

"The 'fence' will be two hundred light years thick, and they'll need to ignite about fifty thousand stars to do it," Decken said. "We cannot assume it is impossible. We must assume the enemy has prepared for this moment and possesses the ability to strike at all of the systems the fence would require."

Hetmwit looked down at his half-eaten meal. "Is there any hope?"

Decken nodded, smiling. "We're alive. Where there is life, there is still hope."

"How?" Hetmwit asked.

"First of all, we need to ask questions that we haven't asked before," Decken said. He activated the holoemitter and brought up a scratch-pad box.

"Here's what we do and don't know," he said.

"Known: They attack systems, kill every living thing, then glass the planet before hellspiking the star.

"Known: If resistance is too fierce, they go with a hellspike novabomb.

"Known: They use hellspace and hellspace portals to move around

"Known: Living things killed by them crumble to ash

"Unknown: Identity

"Unknown: Are what we have seen just weapons, constructions, artificial or conscripted troops, or the actual beings behind it.

"Known: They are building a grav-shadow fence across the galactic arm spur.

"Known: They are doing it by hellspiking the star and using grav lensing to have hellspace infused stellar coronal ejection mass to superluminal speeds in order to create the grav-shadows.

"Unknown, and this is an important one: What are they trying to keep in or keep out?"

Captain Decken leaned back. "Right now we can go around the fence or through the holes, so we need to decide: spinward territory of the Confederacy or anti-spinward? New Confederacy Territories or the Old Systems?"

Hetmwit stared at the two boxes, known and unknown.

"Which systems are in charge of the military?" he asked.

Decken shrugged. "I don't know. It used to be controlled out of Terra. Now? With Terra gone?" he thought for a moment. "I'm going to guess: Smokey Cone. If anyone has the martial ability to keep it together, it'll be the T-Bugs. They're kind of silly, but absolute beasts on the battlefield."

Hetmwit nodded. He didn't know who the T-Bugs were, but if the Captain believed they could help...

"Will they listen to anything we say?" Hetmwit asked.

The Captain smiled. "It doesn't matter that over thirty thousand years have passed since my people vanished, and it doesn't matter than over forty thousand years have passed since this holopic was taken..."

He tapped the holoemitter and a picture appeared.

Captain Decken was shaking hands with a massive insect.

"This picture alone will guarentee that the T-Bugs will listen to me," Decken said. "If not, this one definitely will."

It was of Captain Decken in a full uniform, black cloth, lots of gold braid, standing next to a massive insect wearing star bangles on their antenna, clad in a wrap that glimmered and shone. The insect was in the moment of writing on a large piece of parchment. The insect from the previous picture was next to Captain Decken, wearing a strange hat and carrying pistols in two pistol belts.

"Trust me, Number One, that picture alone will have the T-Bugs all sitting up and listening to anything I say, even if I start rambling on about pink golf balls," Captain Decken smiled.

He looked up. "What is it?"

Decken smiled wider.

"Just the signing of a little document," Captain Decken said. He stood up. "Let's get moving. It's at least two weeks to Treana'ad space."

Ahhh, good old Chapter One Plus Thirty-Two.

OK, y'know, honestly, that's just an awkward construction...  ;)

Nice callback though.

/u/ralts_bloodthorne You might consider a link to the start of NovA Wars, and not just Dark Ages in the header.  Just a passing thought.

That's actually... **less** fucked up than I was expecting?  I was concerned that this new enemy was building a stellar massed, gravitational lensed, connected graph style Lament Configuration via Hellspace portals.  Since, y'know, thus far as I can recall, the series hasn't gone ***there*** yet...

The gelatin was red and had a thick skin around it, but strangely enough Captain Devlintee found she enjoyed the taste and texture of it as she slowly ate her meal. There was some worry when she first started eating, how everything's taste started magnifying, but a call to the nurses assured her that it was perfectly normal since she hadn't used those taste buds before.

Now she had finished her meal, a strange set of dishes, and was enjoying the rubbery strawberry jello.

She knew she was being watched by everyone with a pulse in the immediate vicinity of a full light year.

After all, less than thirty hours ago, she had been killed. Died with the rest of her crew when her ship had exploded with all hands after a hellspace infused nCv barrage slammed home into her unprotected ship.,

Now, she was sitting up in bed, eating jello.

Everything felt new again. She had spent a half hour just combing her fur with her blunt little claws, luxuriating in the feeling. At the advice of the feline counselor who worked with "Respawns" after she had left the care of the canine in "Respawn Recovery" she had taken an actual water shower. The water had been hot, steamy, and poured down on her. She had stood beneath the water, feeling it hammer through her fur and massage her skin.

It had felt amazing.

The feline nurse, one 'Tabitha' or 'Tabbi' for short, had told her the euphoria would end in a few days, would slowly become normal and that it would be even better.

A day since she had respawned and she still felt grateful for her literal new lease on life.

The fact she had not suffered nightmares was good. Apparently humans could suffer nightmares from traumatic death, but species like Hamaroosan had The Bliss, and it made it easier to do post-death trauma counseling.

She had two or three more chances, but with each further one she'd suffer something called unraveling and twisting, which would affect her mind and her quality of life.

She honestly wondered what would come next.

She tapped her spoon against the half square of jello that was left and smiled at the way the spoon bounced and the jello shivered.

There was a knock at the door and she looked up in time to see Admiral (Upper Decks) of the Warsteel Sharnat, commanding officer of the Third Hamaroosan Expeditionary Force, enter her room with a few aides, two doctors, and a pair of nurses.

It was startling just how *large* humans were. It was more than their sheer physical bulk, it was like they were somehow larger than their physical bodies. Her eyes were drawn to them immediately, the way their eyes glanced over the entire room, taking in everything. Their stances made her feel like no matter what happened, the humans were prepared to deal with it quickly and efficiently.

She understood why her ancestors had held the humans in such high esteem forty-thousand years ago.

An aide got a chair for Admiral Sharnat, moving it next to Devlintee's bed.

One of them reached up and turned off the K'Lank Moo Moo Trail Rider Power Hour and Devlintee frowned.

She liked the fast paced colorful cartoon and wanted to know if K'Lank would defeat T'Xh'x's evil plan.

The Admiral stared at her for a long moment while she tapped her jello with the spoon.

"Captain?" Admiral Sharnat said softly.

Captain Devlintee looked from her shivering jello to the Admiral. "Yes, Admiral?"

She loved how her voice sounded. Soft but with a hint of authority, melodious and rich.

"How are you feeling?" the Admiral asked.

"Good. I feel really good," Devlintee said.

The Admiral nodded. "That's good. I was slightly worried about  how you might feel?"

"About having been dead?" Devlintee asked.

The Admiral nodded again. "Yes. Among other things."

Devlintee bounced the spoon on the jello, watching the jello shiver.

"I was told that you were briefly a resident of what the Terrans call 'Hell' before you came back," the Admiral said.

Devlintee shrugged. "Not exactly. The big demon creature had me, but beyond the stench and the heat, I didn't notice anything too terrible. The demon wasn't frightening at the time, but now, thinking about it, it was a little disturbing."

The Admiral sat silently for a moment. "Did the demon say anything?"

Devlintee shrugged. "Kind of. It didn't make sense though."

"What did it say?"

"That I would cause a lot of excitement. Then it told me to have fun and then warned me not to choke on any male genitalia. Then the demon pushed me through the rip in reality and I woke up here," Devlintee said.

"No idea why it chose you to be first?" the Admiral asked.

Devlintee shook her head. "Just that I was 'good enough' and that was all it seemed to care about."

"Hmm," the Admiral looked thoughtful.

"The rest of my crew?" Devlintee asked.

"A few have Respawned. Roughly a hundred. Mostly the ones that died instantly," a Terran female, nearly a whole head shorter than the shortest male, said. Devlintee liked her voice, full of confidence, authority, and quiet competence and professionalism.

It was a voice that commanded respect effortlessly.

"Traumatic Life Cessation Therapy is apparently where the rest are currently placed," a male Terran said.

The timbre of his voice made Devlintee shiver pleasurably.

"What do you plan on doing once you're released from the hospital?" the Admiral asked.

Devlintee thought about it. "Resume command, if that's possible."

The Admiral looked at the Terrans. Two of the males shrugged.

"Would you object to being sent back home? There might be people who want to speak with you?" the Admiral said.

"I would rather not be poked and prodded and I dislike the idea of abandoning my duty," Devlintee said. She shook her head. "I feel fine, Admiral. They say the newness will wear off and I'll back to normal in a few days."

The Admiral just nodded then stood up.

"Well, we'll leave you to your recovery," she said. "As you were."

The Admiral swept toward the door. Right as she went out Devlintee sat up.

"Hey!" Devlintee snapped.

Everyone turned to look.

She pointed at the aide. "Turn back on the Trivee. I want to finish the episode."

The Terrans gave low rumbling chuckles as the Aide sheepishly went over and turned back on the trivee.

Captain Devlintee smiled as she watched the bright cartoon and bounced her spoon on the jello.

0-0-0-0-0

"I knew her before she got killed and I've never seen her like this. It's like she's regressed slightly into childhood," Admiral Sharnat said. She was sitting at a large oval table, her staff on either side of her, the Terrans on the other side.

The big human doctor, without his fearsome plague-mask, just nodded. "That's to be expected. It's Respawn Euphoria. We'll figure out a way to crack it, but it's largely harmless."

"She didn't seem too interested in anything I was saying," Sharnat said.

A Terran feline nodded. "It's because everything is new. Even eating. The old neural pathways that used to handle that, which are largely well worn and/or blown out, as well as your equivalent of dopamine receptors, are all brand new tissue and neural strands. It takes a few days to calm down."

"That makes it hard to care about anything when even breathing is new and exciting," a Terran human said.

"Well, she represents a complete C+ cannon shot into Hamaroosan society," Sharnat said. She shook her head. "Already JAG (Judge Advocate General) is trying to figure out her legal status."

"Why?" a Terran male asked.

Sharnat had to admit, she had turned off the HUD ID bars. Just something about human names were unnerving. A combination of a vague threat along with a joke that she didn't get.

"Well, she's dead. And even my back right-hand cousin, whose possibly the Hamaroosan Star Conglomerate's worst lawyer, could argue that being dead means that not only is her service contract complete, but she's due her death benefits as well as her Military Service Benefit Awards," Admiral Sharnat said. "We don't know if getting killed terminates her obligation to service or not."

The Terrans all nodded slowly.

One, who had a mouth full of sharp, triangular teeth and an auxilary processing wrap across her temples and the back of her head, tapped a long nailed finger on the table and spoke. "If she is Confederate military, according to the Confederate Code of Uniform Military Justice, her term of service is not over. The guidelines and regulations are still there, and nowhere does it say just Terran Descent Human. It states 'any servicemember' which pretty plainly includes the Hamaroosan."

While the bald headed female Terran was speaking black fluid had slowly stained her teeth.

While Hamaroosans had large black eyes themselves, something about the Terran woman's black glossy eyes unnerved Admiral Sharnat.

"Hamaroosan legal codes also have effect," Admiral Sharnat said.

"Not according to the Confederate Code of Uniform Military Justice, they do not," the female Terran countered. "Hamaroosan inductees sign the same paperwork as everyone else, and in Section 844.C19f they have surrendered all other legal representation and rights, including the Confederacy's Fourteen Basic Rights, and have agreed to only be represented by the Code of Uniform Military Justice."

"That can't be right," one of Sharnat's aides protested.

The female Terran flashed a smile of black fluid smeared sharp triangular teeth. "It is correct. Killing of another sentient, sapient, or partially sentient being is illegal in almost all legal codes found outside the military, with the exceptions, possibly, for self-defense or by actors of the State. By enlisting in the Confederate Military Services, an inductee no longer is an individual person but rather an actor of the State, meaning that there is a distinct legal difference between murder and killing. You kill on the battlefield. You murder in the barracks. That puts it simply."

She steepled her long, pale, almost bloodless fingers with the clear fingernails with bluish nail beds.

"The Confederate Code of Uniform Justice protects a Military Services Member from the vagaries of varying governmental legal codes. It is why Confederate military bases are considered Confederate property and the Confederate Code of Uniform Military Justice is the law on post instead of local laws," the female Terran stated, her voice full of some kind of dark malicious glee that Admiral Sarnat wasn't sure about. "There are worlds where the Confederacy has military bases where the mere act of handling a weapon is punishable by decades of imprisonment. If the Confederate military had to abide by such codes, every service member would be subject to immediate arrest."

She sipped at some reddish drink, which stained her teeth dark red.

"I reviewed her inductee paperwork. She is a member of the Hamaroosan Conglomerate Armed Forces," Captain Shreveree, Admiral Sharnat's left hand second cousin stated.

"Then you needed to check further paperwork," the Terran female countered. "Upon graduation of initial and skills training, she was assigned to vessels operating under the Confederacy of Aligned Systems flag, which means she then was transferred to the control of the Confederate Code of Military Justice."

Her smile got wider, almost cruel.

"All of you, every Hamaroosan in this system, is actually under the purview of that same code, not the Hamaroosan Conglomerate Armed Forces Legal Codexes," she said.

Admiral Sarnat blinked. She looked at  Shreveree, who had the unfocused look of someone examining data on her datalink.

"This can't be right," Shreveree said softly. "We lose our Basic Rights? The Right of Consent is limited by the CCMJ? That we can have things done to us or be commanded to do things against our consent?"

"You agreed to consent to all legal orders, commands, and actions when you were inducted into the service," the sharp toothed female Terran said. She looked at the ranking Terran officer. "Although it is undiplomatic and perhaps I should say it in private, but the Hamaroosan and other species have a strange, almost childish understanding of the legal system that protects them."

The general in charge of the meeting nodded. "I blame their drill instructors."

The female Terran nodded. "A fine place to place the blame," she looked at Shreveree directly. "How else do you order men and women to their deaths? How else do you order men and women into combat? Someone's consent is getting violated. Nobody *wants* to die, counselor. Even the Clone War Lyfe troops want to live as long as possible. Consent on the battlefield is extremely limited, and the Hamaroosan ideal of enthusiastic consent for every interaction cannot and should not be applied to warfare."

Shreveree just blinked.

"When you order your troops into battle, be it on the ground, in space, or upon water, you are acting with their implied consent, just as your own commander is acting with your applied consent," the female Terran stated. "Of course, one must always take into account that you are giving orders to heavily armed trained killers, thus the saying: never give an order you know will not be obeyed or cannot be obeyed," she folded her arms. "It's basic leadership principles."

Sharnat had to admit, she had never seen Shreveree completely speechless.

"While, perhaps, under your own *civilian* legal code, or by *Hamaroosan* military laws, the subject may be considered to have completed their term of enlistment once they have been killed and Respawned, under Confederate Law all contracts are still in force and according to the Confederate Code of Uniform Military Justice the subject of this discussion is still a serving member of Confederate Space Force."

Sharnat rapped on the table with one knuckle. "I believe that sets her legal status firmly. She's still a Captain, she's still under my command, and she still is a Confederate Space Force service member."

The female Terran nodded, smiling cruelly at Shreveree.

"How long until she is able to take command?" Sharnat asked.

One of the male Terrans, a canine, gave a shrug. "Hard to tell. We haven't cracked Hamaroosan Respawn Euphoria, so we have to deal with that. We don't know how long it will last. Then she had knowledge and reflex testing. While a Terran Descent Human would return to command within an hour, we current predict that it may take up to two weeks."

Sharnat nodded. "That is more than acceptable."

"Shall we turn to the fabrication side?" a Terran male asked.

Sharnat nodded.

"Right now the creation engines have the templates loaded to replace your losses. Rebuilding is going underway," the Terran tapped the table.

Sharnat stared as it showed what looked like a light dreadnought being assembled in fast forward. The keel slid from a massive glowing iris, then it moved down a line with robotic arms and gantries rapidly assembling it from the core outward.

"So far, replacement component failure rates are in the low parts per trillion," the Terran said. "As you can see, construction of a Terran cruiser class vessel is undergoing at the standard rate of one per six hours."

Sharnat raised her eyebrow tufts and flicked her ears in shock.

"At current rate, your fleet should be completely reconstituted in sixteen days," the Terran said. "It will need, of course, shakedown cruises to identify any mismanufactured or mis-installed components as well as make sure the crews are ready," he tapped the table. "Right now, your biggest problem is manpower."

Sharnat just nodded, staring.

"We're hoping that the return of your Captain means that the SUDS Respawn will allow you to crew the vessels with the former crewmembers before the shakedown cruises are over," the Terran said.

"Are you able to replace the weapons?" Admiral Sharnat asked. "My briefing warned me that your weapons, armor, and shielding would possibly be obsolete."

The Terran nodded. "We have complete template scans of your weapons, drives, and other components. We were able to upgrade the Creation Engines with your new metallurgy and material sciences. We can outfit your ships exactly as they were."

For some reason, Sharnat got the feeling she was being lied to.

Not about the fact they could rebuild her ships right down the tool mark impressions on the bolts.

Just... something about the word 'upgrade' made her feel like the Terran was lying.

"We appreciate that," Sharnat said. She looked around, then back at the Terran. "Until I get orders, I'm holding in this system."

The Terran just nodded.

"Let's figure out spheres of authority."

0-0-0-0-0

Sharnat sat in her cabin, staring at the wall. On it was projected a realtime visual of the two massive refit and repair vessels. They were capable of handling the repairs for a super-heavy colossus hull in drydock conditions.

As she watched a light cruiser keel, what the Terrans considered a destroyer, was being pulled via tractor beam from the glowing red iris.

She timed it.

Six point five minutes until the tugs took possession of the completed light cruiser and moved it to a parking berth on the outside of the repair vessel.

"A dreadful thing has been released upon the universe," she whispered to her dark stateroom.

This interesting post popped up on the sub a few weeks back. The OP nuked it after it started gaining steam. Luckily someone copied the text with all the links and asked for it to be reposted.

**Here’s the original text in its original form, links and all:**


*DISCLAIMER: Before I begin, I want to make a few things crystal clear. I am not at all sure what any of the following actually implies. Nor do I think any of it suggests that Hollywood celebrities are actually in contact with demons or Satan, any more than the existence of Scientologists implies that they are actually in contact with a dictator of a galactic confederacy. I also don't want to disrespect anyone's belief systems, so I'm also not inclined to denounce anyone for believing some celebrities actually are in contact with demons or Satan. My point is that the evidence below is completely neutral on this topic. All it may suggest is that some people in Hollywood have some very odd, and possibly rather sinister beliefs. Which I don't think should be considered too controversial, given the existence of Scientology.*

*I also don't want to implicate Carpenter herself in any of this. For all I know, she is innocent and has no idea how she is being used. There is certainly precedent for this; think of Britney Spears and Michael Jackson. Alternatively, she has been pushed into this role against her will from a young age and is possibly the victim of something akin to Monarch Programming. Or, perhaps even more likely, this is all just confirmation bias and delusion on my part.*

**TL;DR: There seems to some dark occult symbolism surrounding Sabrina Carpenter, perhaps more so than is usual for Hollywood celebs.** 

Unless you live under a rock, you are likely to be aware of the meteoric rise of a pop star named [Sabrina Carpenter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_Carpenter). She became wildly famous after her sugary, addictive single "[Espresso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVli-tstM5E)" topped the charts last summer. Perhaps you found her sudden rise to prominence slightly odd. And indeed, there were a [number of Spotify users](https://www.theguardian.com/music/article/2024/jul/29/the-music-industry-is-engineering-artist-popularity-and-listeners-are-right-to-be-angry) who believed her hit single was being heavily pushed by the platform's algorithms.

But her rise to fame perhaps isn't too surprising. She has been around for a while, with her celebrity career being kickstarted by a supporting role in the Disney comedy [*Girl Meets World*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Meets_World)*.* Bizarrely, there is a [Tumblr page](http://tumblr.com/boymeetsworldilluminati) dedicated to the hidden symbolism in this series and its forerunner *Boy Meets World.* I find most of the "evidence" on there pretty tenuous, but you might find tidbits you think are interesting.

It's perhaps not too surprising that she managed to find a place in Hollywood. After all, [her aunt is the famous Bart Simpson voice actress and leading Scientologist Nancy Cartwright.](https://www.tiktok.com/@officialnancycartwright/video/7389720155133054251?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404358%2C121497414%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C73347566%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121503376%3Bnull%3Bembed_name&refer=embed&referer_url=screenshot-media.com%2Fculture%2Fentertainment%2Fsabrina-carpenter-new-face-scientologys-aunt%2F&referer_video_id=7389720155133054251) In fact, there are even rumours that [her aunt and Tom Cruise are trying to force her to become the new poster child of Scientology.](https://screenshot-media.com/culture/entertainment/sabrina-carpenter-new-face-scientologys-aunt/#:~:text=,bartsimpsonext=,bartsimpson)

To be fair to Carpenter, she didn't just immediately land a supporting role in a Disney comedy. Before that, [she played a bit part in an episode of *Law & Order: Special Victims Unit* as a child who is being controlled by a child exploitation network.](https://lawandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Paula_Moretti) The episode is titled "Possessed". [She also had a bit part in a film called *Horns*,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horns_(film)) where she played the younger version of a girl who is raped and murdered, and then avenged by a man who wakes up with a pair of horns protruding from his head. The horns have special powers that force people to tell him their darkest secrets and desires, and at his bidding, they act upon them. [Carpenter attended the film's premiere wearing an *Alice in Wonderland* outfit.](https://i.imgur.com/f6blNjT.png)

Carpenter's first album, [*Eyes Wide Open*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyes_Wide_Open_(Sabrina_Carpenter_album)), was released in 2015. It was barely noticed, and its songs were nondescript, bland, middle-of-the-road, and totally anodyne. The [title track](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R4VJyfCcOJc), which by no means differed from the tone of the album as a whole, was filmed in the [Park Plaza Hotel, which was originally known as "Elks Lodge No. 99"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Plaza_Hotel_(Los_Angeles)), and was built as a lodge for a secretive Masonic-style fraternity known as the [Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_and_Protective_Order_of_Elks), which counted a number of [extremely powerful people among its members, including six US presidents.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Benevolent_and_Protective_Order_of_Elks_members) But we'll return to this later.

After her debut album, her career remained fairly lacklustre. But in 2019 she released the single ["In My Bed", and an accompanying music video.](https://youtu.be/FN3bTP84GCU?feature=shared&t=1) It is an extremely odd video. It features Carpenter in her bedroom, with huge eyes and extremely dilated pupils, her head jolting from side to side like a woman possessed. The room is filled with children's toys, but also two neon lights of naked women, like you might expect to see in a strip club. Then she is seen in a straight jacket, in a room covered in photos of her as a very small child, with three men in suits taking notes around her. [An article by The Vigilant Citizen details how this appears to connect to Monarch Programming.](https://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/sabrina-carpenters-in-my-bed-a-video-about-the-mind-control-of-a-young-girl-dmade-by-disney/) He claims: 

>Carpenter’s entire act is infused with the occult elite’s agenda. The most obvious proof of this fact is her video *In My Bed*, which clearly portrays the singer as a mind-controlled slave (to fully understand what is about to be explained, read my [article on Monarch programming](https://vigilantcitizen.com/hidden-knowledge/origins-and-techniques-of-monarch-mind-control/) first).

>There’s a lot going on here, especially when one is familiar with the symbolism of Monarch mind control.

>First, the room is filled with butterflies of all shapes and sizes. Monarch mind control is named after the monarch butterfly due to its metamorphosis from a caterpillar to a cocoon, to a butterfly. MK slaves also go through a period of metamorphosis which turns them into a metaphoric butterfly … a very sad and broken metaphoric butterfly.

>Above Sabrina’s head are several clocks – all displaying a different time. This refers to the complete disorientation in time and space of MK slaves due to trauma and dissociation.

He goes on to describe the straightjacket scene:

>Sabrina finds herself in a straitjacket with her eyes still spinning. She is clearly a slave. She is trapped in a room that is obsessively “decorated” with pics of her and at various ages – including baby pics. She is under “their” control since birth.

>Around her are four older men in suits who are observing her, taking notes and, at some point, taunting her. These are Sabrina’s handlers – those who handle her MK programming.

The music video for "In My Bed" isn't the only one of hers that has some rather odd connotations. [The music video for "Feather" ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLbn61Z4LDI)begins with "Sabrina Carpenter" written in a font [nearly identical to the one used at the beginning of the horror film *Rosemary's Baby*](https://i.imgur.com/buhI203.png), and features Carpenter [prancing around a Catholic church in front of the coffins of several young men](https://i.imgur.com/WWjTbjc.png) who have disrespected her. One of the coffins even features a crucifix with ["RIP BITCH"](https://i.imgur.com/HgVbnib.png) written on it. These dancing scenes are intercut with the deaths of those men. One of the men she murders by crushing him in an elevator, his blood trickling out through the doors. The video caused some controversy among the local Catholic community, and [resulted in the parish priest being replaced.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cz0m235y89go) Carpenter responded to the backlash [by joking that "Jesus was a Carpenter"](https://people.com/sabrina-carpenter-feather-video-church-controversy-jesus-was-carpenter-8408101). She has also [worn a T-shirt with this slogan emblazoned on it](https://i.imgur.com/Xr9hmzO.png) on stage.

[And then there is "Taste"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEG7b851Ric). The music video even features a warning at the beginning, regarding its explicit content and graphic violence. It features Carpenter and Jenna Ortega trying to murder each other over and over again in various horrific ways. This includes impalement, shooting, electrocution, and a chainsaw to the guts, each of which is unsuccessful as they are apparently immortal. Perhaps the most interesting method of violence is the use of a [voodoo doll fashioned to look like Carpenter](https://i.imgur.com/kkl3NfF.png), which Ortega throws on a fire, causing the real Carpenter to be burned alive. 

>“In discussing how trauma-based mind-control is done, voodoo must be included as a component. Many of the mind-controlled slaves have had voodoo as part of their trauma, and many had voodoo dolls placed into their Systems. When vows and oaths are made, an object is given to the satanic cult or the Illuminati for the Keeper of the Seals to guard. If the vow is broken voodoo magic can be used against the offender by using the object given in the sealing.”

>– [Fritz Springmeier, *The Illuminati Formula to Create a Mind Controlled Slave*](https://vigilantcitizen.com/musicbusiness/somethings-terribly-wrong-with-sabrina-carpenter-and-her-video-taste/)

It's not only in these flashy music videos that Carpenter seems to be associated with some rather dark things. Towards the end of last year (2024), her fanbase were in uproar after a [YouTuber named Hannah Pearl named her "catfish of the year"](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14240087/fans-defend-sabrina-carpenter-catfish-year-nomination.html). The award was given on the basis of a [supposedly unflattering makeup-free selfie that Carpenter took](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/12/31/21/93627825-14240087-Now_the_social_media_cynic_has_turned_her_sights_to_Hollywood_s_-a-72_1735680529192.jpg). Pearl's [tweet](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/12/31/21/93627821-14240087-image-a-74_1735680529266.jpg), featuring the selfie, went viral as Carpenter fans flocked to defend her. Yet, while everyone was scrutinising this selfie, apparently no-one picked up on the strangeness of the t-shirt Carpenter was wearing in it. Her plain black t-shirt is emblazoned with the quote, "Awake, arise, or be forever fallen". Where could this quote be from? If you are a literature junkie, you might be aware it's from Milton's classic [17th century epic poem *Paradise Lost*](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/111909-awake-arise-or-be-for-ever-fall-n)*.* It is, in fact, a line spoken by Satan to his fallen angels, urging them to be defiant and rise up against God. 

Let's return to that first single, "Eyes Wide Open", filmed in Elks Lodge No. 99. No doubt the first thing that jumps out to you is the song's title, which seems awfully similar to the title of Kubrick's classic film about an elite demonic cult, *Eyes Wide Shut*. But are there any connections with Carpenter to that film, beyond the bizarre location of the video and the similar name? Well, I suppose the first thing that comes to mind is that her aunt is a leading Scientologist, which is also a shadowy elite cult. And of course *Eyes Wide Shut* stars Tom Cruise, perhaps the most famous Scientologist of them all. But all this feels fairly tenuous. Is there anything else that might connect her with the film?

[The Hollywood director Roger Avary has spoken about how at the end of *Eyes Wide Shut*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x7bWlT2q8vs), the two main characters Alice and Bill allow their daughter Helena to be taken away by two shady men who have been in the background of various scenes throughout the film. But before this grim ending, Helena looks at an old fashioned pram, which Avary describes as "the *Rosemary's Baby* bassinet", which he claims is "totally Kubrick saying something". And indeed, it does look very much like the pram featured in the [iconic poster for Rosemary's Baby](https://s3.amazonaws.com/nightjarprod/content/uploads/sites/192/2024/04/29153829/nclYFGpVzfbiORO5ELVVdxzt9Vg.jpg). But what does Helena say when she leans over the pram? She says, ["I could put Sabrina in here"](https://youtu.be/MWaHm2q8soQ?feature=shared&t=22). Then she runs on and [picks up a Barbie](https://youtu.be/MWaHm2q8soQ?feature=shared&t=76). The Barbie in question is the [1996 Sugar Plum Fairy Barbie from *The Nutcracker* collection.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Barbie-Collector-Nutcraker-Classic-Mattel/dp/B0007WL6WM/ref=asc_df_B0007WL6WM?mcid=58c1ebda75cf37e5b073fb570d21cdb5&th=1&psc=1&tag=googshopuk-21&linkCode=df0&hvadid=712027622340&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=18345105282556064947&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=9045622&hvtargid=pla-586712159029&psc=1&gad_source=1)

Let's unpack this a bit. Is there any significance to Helena saying "I could put Sabrina in here"? Well, there is of course the fact that the video for "Feather" begins with Carpenter's name written in the same font and colour as the *Rosemary's Baby* title. There is also the fact that Carpenter was born only a couple of months before the film's release, so that Helena could be talking about her as if she is a baby on the way. And then there is the story of *Rosemary's Baby*, which is about a man who allows his child to be born as the Antichrist in return for Hollywood fame. Then there is the fact that the director, [Roman Polanski, is a child rapist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Polanski) and is well known to have been interested in the occult. His wife, Sharon Tate, was murdered while she was pregnant, just a year after the release of *Rosemary's Baby.* Polanski happened to be away at the time. The official story is that the Manson Family murdered Tate and her friends because the previous occupants of the house had wronged him. Some, however, have suggested that [Polanski was somewhat involved with the Manson Family.](https://open.spotify.com/show/1ijASs6Czv55nioYDms2kF?si=0a0d2a6c2e044b53) 

Was Carpenter planned like Rosemary's baby is in the film, prepared for months or even years in advance? This is all seems like a fairly big stretch. But what about the fact that the very same year that Kubrick released *Eyes Wide Shut*, Polanski released [*The Ninth Gate*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ninth_Gate)? Just like *Eyes Wide Shut*, it's about a clandestine Satanic cult. And just like *Eyes Wide Shut*, it features a Satanic ritual scene. The scene was filmed in [Château de Ferrières](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Ferri%C3%A8res), which was built for the Rothschilds, and is famous for its very [strange parties](https://www.falseart.com/rothschilds-surrealist-ball-at-ferrieres-1972/). Incidentally, the exterior scene of the Somerton mansion in *Eyes Wide Shut*, where the Satanic ritual takes place, is [Mentmore Towers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentmore_Towers). James Mayer de Rothschild commissioned Château de Ferrières to be ["another Mentmore, but twice the size."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Paxton#Later_life) And what about the fact that Satan is incarnated in *The Ninth Gate* as a nameless, young, pretty, blonde woman?

Perhaps this is all confirmation bias. Perhaps I'm seeing patterns where there aren't. But there is one last thing that bugs me. As mentioned, in the final scene of *Eyes Wide Shut*, after Helena looks at the *Rosemary's Baby* pram she picks up a Sugar Plum Fairy Barbie doll. The Sugar Plum Fairy is a character in the ballet [*The Nutcracker*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nutcracker), which is about a collection of dolls that come alive. Carpenter, of course, has featured voodoo dolls in her music videos, and indeed she often looks very doll-like. The idea of a "living doll" also seems to resonate with Monarch Programming. But there's something more. In her Netflix Christmas special, [A Nonsense Christmas with Sabrina Carpenter](https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/a-nonsense-christmas-with-sabrina-carpenter-holiday-variety-music-special), there is a very odd moment near the middle of the special's duration. A scene ends and we are left alone with Carpenter in a kitchen. For no apparent reason, [she picks up a knife and stares at its tip](https://i.imgur.com/lMh4PeA.png) as if she is hypnotised. The tune playing in the background?: "[Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_of_the_Sugar_Plum_Fairy)".

Summarized in 10 bullets:

1. Sabrina Carpenter’s fame and media presence seem sudden and possibly artificial, with odd symbolism and promotion fueling theories.  

2. Family ties to Scientology, especially aunt Nancy Cartwright and rumored links to Tom Cruise, raise eyebrows.  

3. Early roles in dark or traumatic media, like SVU and Horns, suggest a pattern of disturbing themes.  

4. The music video for “In My Bed” is filled with Monarch programming-style imagery, including butterflies, clocks, and suited handlers.  

5. “Feather” video mimics Rosemary’s Baby aesthetics and features Carpenter dancing in a church with violent imagery.  

6. The “Taste” video shows repeated cartoonish murder and a voodoo doll ritual, connecting again to trauma symbolism.  

7. A viral selfie had her wearing a t-shirt quoting Satan from Paradise Lost, mostly unnoticed by fans.  

8. Her debut song “Eyes Wide Open” was filmed in a Masonic Elks Lodge, with parallels drawn to Eyes Wide Shut.  
	
9. A line from Eyes Wide Shut (“I could put Sabrina in here”) sparks speculation about predictive symbolism and occult grooming.  
	
10. Recurring themes of dolls, rituals, and hypnotic behavior, like in her Christmas special with Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, suggest a surreal and possibly sinister narrative thread.

FYI this copy pasta is a part of a recent PR run for Sabrina carpenter to give her a more spooky edge as part of a rebranding campaign. She’s an industry plant and all of this is manufactured lore to broaden her appeal and demographic

Like Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, and so many RPGs that have come before it, the little expedition that could will be plastered across history with the greats. Bravo.

Some technical flaws are present, but they do not overshadow the overall visual power.

>Clair Obscur Expedition 33 is a once in a generation title that transcends gaming, and approaches a work of art. From it’s unique and compelling story, its cast of characters that are some of the best in the industry, a world design that feels more like a painting rather than a video game, and the other the top combat animations that are larger than life, Expedition 33 has it all! My personal favorite game this year, and now one of my all time favorite games as well. Don’t miss out one of the most memorable experiences you can have in entertainment, and get this Day 1!

>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the most stunning surprises of this generation delivering a deep philosophical story set in a visually breathtaking world with gorgeous graphics and an addictive turn-based combat system! With its tense battles and unpredictable twists, it'll keep you on the edge of your seat. If you're looking for an experience that echoes the best of turn-based while adding modern and innovative touches then this game definitely deserves a spot on your must-play list.

>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a masterpiece that clearly draws inspiration from other RPG's, but does so with such elegance and skill that it stands firmly on its own in an overcrowded genre – thanks in part, of course, to its own unique tricks. In an age of cynicism and uncertainty, it's wonderful to get our hands on something this magical.

>Quite possibly the best RPG of its kind. Epic story with heartfelt moments, best-in class combat, gorgeous graphics and music that will linger for the rest of my life. I’ll be humming some of these tunes in the retirement home. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the real thing. This game will go down in history as a must-play RPG.

>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 not only deftly improves upon the idea of active turn-based combat, but delivers it in a gorgeous and realized world. The characters are incredible, it dodges some of the more grating aspects of turn-based RPGs, and delivers a mature, and at times haunting, story, without falling into the traps of too much violence for the sake of maturity. A big narrative turn flattens the experience, and a few too many rough edges keep it from masterpiece status, but it is still an incredible experience.

>Expedition 33 is magnificent in every possible way. I was in love with it whole time and while playing I’ve became so engaged with characters and the story surround them I forgot the flow of time entirely. This is clearly the future for JRPG’s and it’s sense of scale is outstanding. Definitely a classic for years to come.

>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is one of the most refreshing and original RPGs in years, even if it's not immediately obvious from the outside looking in. The intriguing setup expands to provide an engrossing, excellent narrative with lovable and charismatic characters. The exemplary combat goes above and beyond its turn-based traditions with flashy fights and new ways to damage. This is the kind of experience that proves there's still so much potential and creativity in the bigger-budget video game space - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is simply sublime.

>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that blasts the senses from beginning to end.  The melancholic and bleak moments are balanced by the characters' perseverance, which makes their triumphs shine much brighter.  There's a profound sense of style and substance that only expands as more of the world is uncovered.  What results is a true work of art that ties its brilliant components together into a complete package, which is awe inspiring to come from a freshman developer.

>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a rare triumph for such a small studio. The devs at Sandfall Interactive aimed for the stars, and they delivered a game that JRPG fans have always wanted from a Western studio. I can't recommend this game enough.

>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a milestone achievement for Sandfall Interactive. Fans of turn-based RPGs should be right at home with its traditional stylings tuned for a modern age, and while difficulty can ramp up without warning, the challenge of getting through each battle makes it all worthwhile.

>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a masterful RPG. It brings a stunning art style that stays front and center while revamping a classic combat system into something engaging and accessible. It's an easy contender for GOTY and a terrific debut for Sandfall Interactive.

-------------

**[Tom's Hardware Italia](https://opencritic.com/outlet/861/toms-hardware-italia)** - [Giulia Serena](https://opencritic.com/critic/9509/giulia-serena) - *Italian* - [9.5 / 10](https://www.tomshw.it/videogioco/clair-obscur-expedition-33-recensione)

>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 will captivate you from the very first moment. We are talking about a work that manages to stand out in the RPG landscape for its extraordinary ability to blend narrative, art direction, and game mechanics into a cohesive and deeply evocative experience. Sandfall Interactive gives us a tale dense with emotions and brilliant moments, where the pain of grief intertwines with resistance, memory, and the struggle for survival.
>However, it's not just the narrative aspect that works well: the combat system, a hybrid of turn-based and real-time action, represents one of the game's highlights, offering deep and never repetitive dynamics that enhance each character's unique traits and satisfy both RPG enthusiasts and those who want to enjoy a more relaxed experience. The art direction, on the other hand, is a true homage to Impressionist and Symbolist painting, with scenarios that look like they were taken from an art gallery and settings inspired by a dreamlike, deconstructed Paris.
>In short, Expedition 33 is not just a journey through decadent lands and evocative settings: it's a path that constantly challenges the perception of reality and dream, light and darkness, life and death. With solid longevity, a world rich in activities, and a surprisingly polished technical aspect, the title emerges not only as one of the most fascinating and significant surprises in the genre, but also as one of the best video games (so far) of this 2025.

>Final Fantasy, Persona, Chrono Trigger are just some of the inherent influences, but it was the inspiration from Sekiro and the French heritage of Sandfall Interactive that made Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 feel like the dawn of a new era of turn-based RPG’s, as it equally pays tribute to those who came before, as much as it innovates for those who will come after. 
>
>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a breath of fresh air because it prioritizes a compelling vision over following trends. It doesn’t resort to witty sarcasm in its dialogue or try to capitalize on current popular settings for the story, and there isn’t an attempt to infuse the latest real-time gameplay gimmicks. Sandfall have made a bold decision, especially considering it’s their debut title, to deviate from modern RPG conventions. Trends don’t age well, but artistic vision does and Expedition 33 has all the markings of becoming a timeless classic.

>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a confident new IP, bold in its execution and not afraid to mix old and new ideas. It's a stunning achievement, born from passion and raised within technical excellence equal to the best in the business. Go in unspoiled and be ready for a truly rewarding experience.

>As you can hopefully tell, I absolutely adore Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It’s the first game in some time that I’ve found myself utterly lost in, so much so that I genuinely did not want to put the controller down. Any minor gripes there might be to have (some areas can get a little confusing to navigate at times, though none are so big that it remains a problem for long) are easily outnumbered by the sheer brilliance of the full product from start to finish. Combat, presentation, exploration, story; it’s all so damn good that I cannot recommend highly enough that you go play this game. We’ve still got a long way to go this year, and a few big hitters to come, but man, it’ll take something special to give Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 a run for its money.

>All in all, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 stands out as one of the biggest surprises of 2025 so far — a title that boasts a deep, unpredictable story, meticulously crafted gameplay and combat systems, and top-tier visual and audio presentation. This game isn’t just for fans of turn-based RPGs; it has the potential to impress anyone who appreciates high-quality experiences. Even if you’re not typically drawn to turn-based games, I highly recommend giving this polished gem a try — it’s well worth investing at least 30 hours of your playtime.

I was worried, given how fresh the team was and how big the scope of the project, but reviews seem fantastic, so that's very nice. That definitely puts it higher on the priority list for me.

RPGSite notes around 25-30 hours and double if you do a lot of optional content, so that also seems quite reasonable.
```

**Comment #2** by u/MagnvsGV (89 points, 2025-04-23 07:25):
```
I'm honestly surprised, not by the positivity per se, but by the average score, which will likely generate a lot of buzz even outside of the niche which was already hyping the game for a long time. The developers must be overjoyed, there are many veteran RPG teams both in the West and in Japan with lots of titles under their belts who never achieved anything near this kind of critical reception.

This also seems to be a landmark result for French RPG development, probably the most important they've seen after Spiders' Greedfall made waves in the WRPG space, and I can only hope it's able to inspire other RPG efforts not just in France but in Europe as a whole.

pricing is also really good in my country, and 92 is just insane.

Really cool to see both Clair Obscur and [Hundred Line](https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/s/pkQVxszXeo) getting high scores and lauching on the same day.

Such a good time to be a JRPG fan.

Wow, I was expecting mid 80s, happy for the team.

Anyways, onto the big important question - who is calling dibs on the 69th thread calling Square Enix trash for not sticking to turn based with Final Fantasy? You know it's coming. Completely inevitable.

This Week in Destiny, we have more details to share from The Edge of Fate. We are getting closer and closer to July 15, so today we are talking about the incoming weapons tuning as well as some economy changes. And let's not forget about the developer stream from Tuesday, the gear tiering Dev Insight article from yesterday, and the other topics you can see below.



* We had a livestream on Tuesday!
* A new Rite of the Nine challenge
* Announcing our World First Race hosts
* GCX, here we go
* Kepler Restricted Brief
* Weapons, Power and Economy Updates
* Destiny 2 Open Access
* Bungie Day is almost here
##Thank You For Watching!


We hope you all enjoyed our second livestream for The Edge of Fate. We covered some of the new activities, rewards and systemic changes coming in July 15. We started our stream with The Edge of Fate launch trailer, that you can watch just right below. Spooky, right?

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/5LFBTFpWYVI)

We covered a lot of topics during our first section. Unlockable world tier difficulties for the campaign. Side quests that you unlock after completing it. Matterball banes. A three-player activity that uses the abilities you unlock in Kepler. The new destination is filled with many secrets and Guardians are tasked with uncovering all of them and choosing how hard a challenge they want to face. Also, what's going on with all the fungi?



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/bltec22ef990bbc5edb/68657b5aade219782288981c/portal.jpeg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/fAIf93u.jpeg)

Next we talked in depth about The Portal. We have a lot of activities available in our new hub, from Onslaught to some favorite seasonal activities like The Coil. You can choose from a big pool of modifiers to tune the experience and up the challenge in order to get bonus rewards. The goal is to make activities not only more rewarding and personalized, but also to make them easier to understand. There are tons of new ways to enjoy your favorite game with Solo Ops, Fireteam Ops and Crucible Ops, and also Pinnacle Ops, plus a section dedicated to activities like Exotic Missions that will get their unique rewards. To make it easier to understand and follow, we have reworked Guardian Ranks to focus on The Portal and its activities.



We also have the new Seasonal Hub, with weekly ranks, daily and weekly challenges, and tons more gear to earn, and that resets every week. If you complete the Conquests also available at this hub and progress through the different difficulty settings, you will also earn the renewed Conqueror Title. Don't worry, if you already have gilded it a few times, you will keep your marks.



And we didn't forget about Power in The Edge of Fate! We have a whole section in this TWID about it with many more details, so we'll skip it here. Just keep scrolling and you'll get there. For now, just don't get too worried when you are Power level 10 when you start playing our next expansion.



Hope this recap of the livestream helped everyone get an understanding of the most relevant topics we covered. If you want to get the whole picture, though, why not watch the whole stream by yourself? It's right below.

##Rite of the Nine Final Update


As we move into the final two weeks of Rite of the Nine, we wanted to share some updates coming next week to close with a bang.



Do you remember Daybreak? Yeah, the old school modifier where you abilities recharge like crazy. How fun would it be to turn it on for the Explorer Mode version of the Rite of the Nine dungeons for next week? Because it's happening right now. Fetch your friends, put on some destructive Supers and go farm like mad. Remember that on top of weapons, you can also use your Nonary Manifold to earn Nonary Engrams that contain some fan favorite cosmetics.



Additionally, in preparation for The Edge of Fate, two servants of the Nine are bringing gifts to Guardians. Both Xûr and the Emissary will have desirable Exotics that will be part of the featured gear on day one of the new expansion. Bring your Strange Coins and Nonary Manifolds and snag some loot.



As a final reminder, here’s the picture for the next two weeks:



* Current Week: Prophecy is featured, with increased rewards.
* Until July 15, players can earn Nonary Engrams.


* Starting July 1, players may purchase Nonary Engrams using 350 Nonary Manifolds at The Emissary (up to 20 during Rite of the Nine).


* Starting July 8, players will be awarded one additional Nonary Engram each day, just for signing in. Just be sure to claim it from The Emissary.

* From July 8 until July 15, "lootapalooza" will begin.


* Increased currency rewards and weapon drops from enemies in all dungeons.


* Even more increased loot from the final boss chest when completing all encounters.
###A New Challenge Appears


We also have one last Rite of the Nine dungeon hurrah before we dive into our new expansion. The team at Destiny Tracker are running two weekends of challenges around Prophecy and Spire of the Watcher to wrap up Rite of the Nine!



From July 4 – 6 PT, complete Prophecy on Eternity mode as fast as you can, and from July 11 – 13 PT, complete Spire of the Watcher as fast as you can – solo, duo, or with a full fireteam. You can win prizes such as Silver, one of nine exclusive Starhorse-inspired headphone holders fabricated by [Hench and Scrap](https://henchandscrap.com/), and a premium Rite of the Nine-themed PC unit created by Overkill.

##World First Raid Race is Back


Guardians, we have a new raid ready for July 19, and you know what that means: there will be a new World First Race where the most capable teams around the globe will conquer Contest Mode difficulty and fight to be the first team to complete the raid.



We’re excited to confirm we have partnered once again with the wonderful [CBGray](https://x.com/cbgray_) and [evanf1997](https://x.com/evanf1997_) to bring you the Raid Race action, live from Bungie HQ this time!

##Bungie at GCX


Guardians, we're excited to share something special coming your way at GCX 2025! On July 25th from 3-4:30pm EST, we're hosting an exclusive developer panel that'll take you deep into the heart of Destiny 2's storytelling process.



**Threads of Fate: Exploring Destiny 2's Narrative Craft** will give you an unprecedented look at how one expansion story goes from initial pitch deck all the way through development to launch, with a special focus on The Edge of Fate. You'll get to see behind the curtain of our creative process and discover what it takes to craft the narratives that drive your Guardian's journey.



We're thrilled to have D2 Narrative Team members **Alison Luhrs** and **Hannah Filipski** joining us for this deep dive. These are the talented minds behind some of your favorite story moments, and they'll be sharing insights you won't find anywhere else.

##Brief 001


**VANGUARD – KEPLER RESTRICTED BRIEF – ALL POINTS BULLETIN**



**GUARDIAN OPERATIVE,**



Dispatch contains restricted information for select fireteams and will purge its data upon closure.



**THE HOUSE OF EXILE**



**CLASSIFICATION**



* Eliksni House
* Uknown Fungal Symbiosis

**HAZARDS**



* Standard Eliksni armaments, mines, and traps
* Modified armament**

   * Strand Spear
   * Stasis Screen
* Heightened reactions and subdued pain response
* Telepathically receptive

**INTEL**



* House of Exile is a lower House made predominantly from the remains of other Houses defeated at Twilight Gap. However, according to the Cryptarchy, the Exile banner pre-dates Twilight Gap, albeit without an official title. It was simply a collection of malcontents, outcasts and, well, exiles during the ‘Long Drift’ to Earth from Riis.
* While many of the Exiles reconstituted into a House on the Moon, Luna, a subsect of the House broke away prior to the battle of Twilight Gap, refusing to invade Earth. They retreated to the edge of the Sol system to live in peace. The Exiles on Kepler are believed to be those defectors.
* Paracausal weaponry has been encountered. Guardians should take maximum precautions during engagements on Kepler. Select House of Exile armaments have been noted to contain Stasis crux cores or compressed Strand tangles suspended in a mixture of Eliksni technology reminiscent of House Salvation forces under the Witness, and an unknown energetic charge.

****[HIDDEN LOG TRANSCRIPT CHA-KEP-1024]**



The following transcript documents the House’s acquisition of Strand and Stasis technology.



“Do you see now, the gifts of which I spoke? Here they are set before you, as I foretold. The Deathless comes for us, and so the Giver arms our people in defiance. Through time and space I have claimed--at the Giver’s behest--lost and side-cast technology of our broken siblings on Light-conquered worlds. Where they fell, we stand, by the will of the Giver.



**OF NOTE**



* Exiles on Kepler seem to have undergone a sort of fungal symbiosis with local fauna. It is unknown why or how this happened, but the fungus appears to feed from the dark matter of the singularity the Exiles rever at the heart of Kepler.
* There appears to be a sort of stylistic hierarchy among the Exiles. While it affords no actual authority, the size, shape, and unique features of fungal growths sported on their armor or hosted on their chitin impact relationships, respect, and clout within the House.
* Initial reports suggest the House of Exile was not always hostile and, at one time, even worked alongside the ‘Aionian’ population of Kepler.

##Weapons Tuning for The Edge of Fate


Hello again from the Destiny 2 Sandbox Team! Like most other areas of the game, weapons have gotten many changes in The Edge of Fate so let’s get right into it. Before that, though, a reminder that yesterday we published a Dev Insight article focused on weapons and gear tiering. We hope it helped you understand the new system a bit better and that you can use it as a source of truth moving forward. In case you have not read it yet, [here is a link to it](https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/dev_insights_weapon_gear_tier). Now, let’s jump right into the weapon tuning content.



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt022e21f78b184dbc/65ce1f17bccfe26ca0e98e57/Weapons_FrontPageBanner_PC_1920x590.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/bQHN3Mo.jpeg)
###Weapon Archetypes

####Machine Guns


We’re trying out something new for Destiny on Machine Guns:staged reloads! Machine Guns generally have *very* long reload animation times that can be very punishing when cancelled. We have added several checkpoints from which the animation can now be resumed if it is interrupted mid reload. This is a feature we are rolling out on Machine Guns first, but we plan to expand this to other weapon types in the future.



* Now have a staged reload

   * Staged reload places checkpoints in the reload animation.
   * When a player cancels a reload animation and starts it again, it will resume from the latest checkpoint.
####Glaives


The projectile changes for Glaives in Heresy have been generally very positive for the archetype but ended up opening up a small window where it was actually a nerf to the weapons projectile performance, particularly at short range in PvP. We’ve made some adjustments to account for this issue.



* Reduced projectile tracking strength at very close range to avoid a behavior that made the projectiles less accurate.
###Perks

####Reconstruction


Reconstruction has been underperforming on non-Rocket Launcher weapons since the nerf that increased the time it needs to start filling a weapon's mag, so we're greatly increasing the amount of ammo transferred on each activation.



* Increased the amount of ammo transferred per activation from 10% to 25%.
####Paracausal Affinity


We generally think it's pretty important for players to be able to anticipate when a damage buff is going to expire, since having one active or not is something players are often making heat-of-the-moment gameplay decisions about.



* Added a visible timer to the buff.
####Kinetic Tremors


Kinetic Tremors feels good to use on faster-firing weapon frames, but it can underperform a bit on slower-firing ones.



* Decreased shots to activate on certain weapons and subfamilies.
* High-Impact Auto Rifles require nine hits down from 12.
* Aggressive and High-Impact Scout Rifles require five hits down from six.
* Hand Cannon subfamilies have received specific tuning,
* Aggressive Hand Cannons require four hits down from six.
* Adaptive Hand Cannons require five hits down from six.
* Precision Hand Cannons are unchanged and still require six shots to activate.
####One-Two Punch


This was covered in our 6/19 TWID on melee changes, but we're copying it here for posterity.



* Now works with all melee abilities. Perk active time increased from 1.22 seconds to 3 seconds.
####Attrition Orbs


Attrition Orbs is currently too powerful on Area Denial Grenade Launchers, but it is somewhat underwhelming on other weapon types.



* Increased perk progress by 20% across the board.
* Reduced perk progress by 80% with Area Denial Grenade Launchers

   * This is surprisingly not as noticeable as it sounds.
* Increased perk progress by an additional 30% on Swords.
####Eager Edge & Valiant Charge


Eager Edge's aggressive target tracking presents two problems: it makes it more frustrating to use this perk for mobility in PvE, and it makes it somewhat oppressive in PvP. Valiant Charge has some similar issues - it can track to unintended targets relatively often, which undercuts some of the "riposte" fantasy that the perk functionality suggests.



* While active, melee search angle is now reduced by 50% at the start of lunge range and by 88% at the edge of lunge range.
* This requires the player look more at their target to strike it, improving specific target acquisition in PvE and requiring a more direct look in PvP.
####Chain Reaction


As fun as the Chain Reaction + Hatchling interaction is, it is inconsistent with other perk combinations, which are generally not allowed to chain explosions together. It's important to be as consistent as possible when we handle these interactions - we don't want our players' ability to tell if a weapon roll is good or not to be dependent on knowing which perks chain with each other and which don't when it is not listed in-game.



* Threadlings created by weapon perks will no longer activate the detonation from Chain Reaction.
####Chain Reaction, Dragonfly, Firefly


These perks currently deal different amounts of damage to different targets based on the type of weapon that activates the perk. In many cases, this makes these perks even worse on weapons that do not use them well in the first place - it's harder to get a precision kill with a Submachine Gun than it is a Hand Cannon, but Dragonfly also deals less damage when a Submachine Gun activates it. We want perks to feel stronger on different weapon types for obvious reasons (such as how often a weapon gets precision kills) rather than unintuitive ones.



* Chain Reaction, Dragonfly, and Firefly no longer use weapon archetype scaling against combatants and instead use a new perk damage scaling that is more normalized between different weapon types. 

   * This buffs many weapons with these perks against most targets.
* Here's some of the biggest winners from this change:

   * Fusion Rifles deal 41% more Chain Reaction damage to minor combatants.
   * Submachine Guns deal 43% more Dragonfly and Firefly damage to minor combatants.
   * Auto Rifles deal 47% more Dragonfly damage to minor combatants.
   * Linear Fusion Rifles deal 165% more Chain Reaction damage to minor combatants and at least 124% more Chain Reaction to all other combatants (varies slightly based on combatant type).
   * Swords deal 123% more Chain Reaction damage to minor combatants and at least 193% more Chain Reaction damage to all other combatants (varies slightly based on combatant type).

In the interest of transparency, we want to call out the three instances where this change results in a nerf of at least five percent decreased damage. We do not expect any of these to have serious impacts on balance or perk desirability.



* Hand Cannons deal 20% less Dragonfly and Firefly damage to major combatants.
* Sniper Rifles deal eight percent less Firefly and Dragonfly damage to minor combatants.
* Special Ammo Wave Frame Grenade Launchers deal six percent less Chain Reaction damage to major, champion, and miniboss combatants, and 14% less Chain Reaction damage to ultra and vehicle combatants.
###Champion Interaction Changes


In Season 20, we added the ability for subclass verbs (Ignition, Jolt, Suppression, etc.) to stun Champions and have since added these verbs to weapon traits and various Exotic weapons through rebalances. We quickly realized these weapons had issues when paired with anti-Champion effects from sources like the Artifact or radiant.



To prevent erratic behavior, we barred certain Exotics from gaining external anti-Champion capabilities. It has become unclear to the player which Exotic weapons are excluded, so we decided to address this issue formally.



We have now made certain Exotic weapons (most of which applied a subclass verb through gameplay) intrinsically anti-Champ and will adhere to the following soft rule from now on:



*Weapons that intrinsically have the anti-Champion symbol in the weapon tray cannot receive anti-Champion capabilities from the Artifact or from radiant-like effects. Otherwise, they can receive external anti-Champion capabilities and be able to continue their subclass verb anti-Champ capabilities.*


###Exotic Weapons


[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt07192d8311a32ab8/6734f2fe53e3c4148eb3c429/exotic_weapons.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/QxAirrm.jpeg)
####Vigilance Wing


Vigilance Wing's Exotic trait Last Stand felt left behind by things like the Alacrity origin trait, so we have made a change that will allow it to be active when running solo in PvE activities.



* Last Stand bonus is now active when running solo in PvE activities.
####Hierarchy of Needs


Hierarchy of Needs is a cool weapon that currently restricts the player's actions too much. We wanted to increase flexibility with the weapon while keeping its fantasy intact, and while we were at it, we let it interact with other bows wielded by your allies or yourself.



* Players now gain charges of Guidance Ring with any hit from Hierarchy of Needs, and now only need three charges to deploy the ring.
* Hierarchy's spawned Guidance Ring duration increased from 13s to 20s.
* Hierarchy's spawned Guidance Ring now rotates to face its owner.
* Players are now limited to one Guidance Ring in the world per player. Spawning a second one will remove your previous ring.
* All Bows now spawn missiles when fired through an allied player's Guidance Ring.

   * Yes, all Bows.
* Fixed an issue where Hierarchy's seeker missiles would not play detonation visual effects when colliding with world geometry.
####Dead Man's Tale


Dead Man's Tale has developed a reputation in the Crucible over its years in game but has always struggled a bit in PvE. We've made some adjustments to help it cancel out its long reload time and reward players more for landing their headshots.



* Each stack of cranial spike now grants:

   * +3.4% damage vs combatants (max 17% at 5 stacks)
   * +1 rounds reloaded
####Duality


The previous set of changes to Duality were good but didn't do quite as much as we were hoping. We've relaxed the trigger on its trait perk to allow it to ramp into good single target damage more consistently.



* Added a secondary activator for On Black Wings, now gives the buff when landing most of your pellets on a target
####The Navigator


The Navigator is an interesting Exotic but has felt a bit one-trick for its woven mail and tangle creation. We've added a bonus to the weapon while the wielder has woven mail to let it excel while you are using it for its original purpose.



* When the user has Woven Mail:

   * Increased damage

      * 25% in PVE
      * 5% in PVP
   * Increased ammo generation stat
####Wicked Implement


We've shifted Wicked Implement to a faster fire rate to better align with its gameplay fantasy. With our recent changes to how Stasis interacts with Champions, we've also made Wicked Implement to be anti-overload intrinsically to align with Stasis's role in the sandbox.



* Now is Rapid Fire RPM.
* Now takes one additional hit to start slowing and to freeze to account for the faster rate of fire.
* Increased magazine size to 20,
* Is now intrinsically anti-Overload.
####Heartshadow


A big constrictor for a lot of Heavy Swords is just how fast they chew through ammo. It makes it hard to choose when and where to use them, especially for a weapon like Heartshadow that very much wants you to use it to clear out chaff by peeking in and out of invisibility, so with these changes we've leaned harder into that fantasy.



* Increased ammo reserves.
* Reduced cost of heavy attack to three (from four).
* Added: "Defeats while Shot in the Dark is active make you invisible once more."
####Worldline Zero


Worldline has always been a fun Sword to play with but has largely fallen out of favor ever since it lost its ability to let you skate, alongside the introduction of Eager Edge. To give it a more defined niche, we are leaning into its Tesseract ability, emphasizing add clear via rapid nimble teleports.



* Increased lunge distance of the heavy Tesseract attack by 3m.
* Removed the ability to chain two blink attacks back to back.
* Added a new effect: "Defeating a target with Tesseract allows you to Tesseract again for a short duration."

   * These extra blink attacks cost less ammo and consumes less guard energy.
####Devil's Ruin


Devil's Ruin is another Exotic that has felt a bit one-trick for a long time now. We have reworked the weapon to remove its fire-on-release behavior as well as making the beam mode more of a reward, once it has been enabled.



* Removed fire on release behavior.
* Beam is now behind special reload.
* Kills with the weapon make firesprites and picking up a firesprite enables the special reload.
* Beam now scorches on hit and ignites on kills.
* Increased magazine size to 20.
* Is now intrinsically anti-unstoppable.
####Tommy’s Matchbook


Tommy's Matchbook runs into issues with survivability and overall useability. These changes focus on improving that experience, allowing players to maintain Ignition Trigger even if they stop shooting for a moment, and providing intrinsic avenues to heal back lost health without completely removing buildcrafting potential. We also wanted to provide a higher incentive for players to hip-fire this weapon and improve how self-damage is communicated to the user and to other players.



* General

   * Added a burning screen effect while the player takes self-damage from Ignition Trigger. Other players who are taking self-damage from Ignition Trigger will now have a burning effect surrounding their model.
* Ignition Trigger

   * The HUD buff now appears as a bar. While Ignition Trigger is active, the bar charges as you fire the weapon and drains when you don't. So long as the bar has some charge, Ignition Trigger will remain active.
* Heat Sink

   * Hip-fire self-damage decreased to 50% less damage than ADS self-damage, previously 33% less damage.
   * Catalyst

      * Removed improved health regen. Now final blows while Ignition Trigger is active grant Cure x1 to the user.
   * Scorch on hit is unchanged.
####Winterbite


With the massive update to how melee damage works, this always-on effect on Winterbite ended up being a bit too much free damage, especially in comparison to Swords. Like Wicked Implement, Winterbite will now be intriniscally anti-Overload to align with the changes made to Stasis Shatter’s Cchampion stunning.  



* Reduced enhanced melee damage with ammo to +20% vs bosses, down from +50%

   * This is to account for this now being able to recieve melee damage bonuses from a variety of sources.
* Is now intrinsically anti-Overload.
####Anti-Champion Changes


The following weapons have not been rebalanced but have been given anti-Champion capabilities intrinsically:



* Anti-Unstoppable

   * Queensbreaker
   * Salvation's Grip
   * Dragon's Breath
* Anti-Overload

   * Tractor Cannon
   * DARCI
   * Two-Tailed Fox
* Conditional Finality can be anti-Overload or anti-Unstoppable depending on which element is active.
###Regarding PvP


For those of you looking for PvP tuning numbers, we’re aware of the math in terms of balancing around fixed health values and the new weapon stat damage bonuses. We have our finger on the trigger, and are aimed at a number of targets, but we want to make sure the weapons and perks we choose to tune actually become balance issues, instead of preemptively nerfing a bunch of builds or playstyles before you are even able to try them out.



Once it is known how realistic it is to achieve certain stat combos, and what tradeoffs those stat splits enforce, we’ll have a more complete picture to determine how problematic these builds actually are in the Crucible. We’ll be watching and gathering your feedback, and we are standing by ready to adjust as necessary in near future updates.


##Power in The Edge of Fate


With the reimagining of Destiny 2’s core game experience comes a refreshed version of player Power. We’ve overhauled how you earn Power and what it means to your journey across the season to be a more meaningful experience; we’ve also removed weekly barriers and are giving you more agency in choosing how you want to level up. 



Earning Power will be more intuitive than ever before, with most activities even offering a reward forecast that enables you to plan your rewards. Increase your Power by overcoming greater challenges and earn higher tiers of both armor and weapons that come with additional stats and benefits!


###Refreshing Power 


The first thing you’ll notice when you log in to The Edge of Fate is the Power refresh. Power inflation over the years has created huge numbers that can be confusing and unintuitive, particularly for new and returning players.  



When The Edge of Fate releases on July 15th, Power will be refreshed to start at 10 for a much cleaner and more intuitive experience. Legacy Power will still be visible on the Power tooltip (shown when you hover over your Power number on the Character screen) if you want to know what your Power would be in the old system. 


###The Power Band 


In the updated “Power Band” (from 10 to 200), Power will work as it traditionally did when playing up to the previous “Soft Cap.” You’ll see progress just by finding gear across whatever you want to play, from the new Edge of Fate Expansion, to PvP, to patrolling your favorite classic destination. Playing activities on the Portal will offer increased progression, while completing missions and finding secret chests in Fate Saga expansions will offer the fastest progression. 



Lots of activity content will exist in the Power Band, including the entire The Edge of Fate Expansion Pack, Event activities, all legacy content, and even the new [REDACTED] raid. While these activities won't ask you to earn more than 200 Power to play at max effectiveness, they may offer rewards above 200 when played at harder difficulties (more on that later). 



During the climb to the Power Cap of 200, you will be able to earn Tier 1, Tier 2, and even the occasional Tier 3 drops. This gear is as strong as Legendary or even Adept weapons from before The Edge of Fate. Your progress up to the Power Cap will also stick around into the new season when Destiny 2: Renegades releases in December, giving you consistent access to gear as strong as (or even better than) what you’re used to, as well as tons of activities to play. 


###Seasonal Bonus Power 


Since Shadowkeep, the Seasonal Artifact has offered a way to increase your Power above the Power Cap through Artifact Bonus Power. While this was a great way to get an advantage in high Power activities, it wasn’t consistent with finding new, better gear. Driven instead by XP, it incentivized behaviors like bounty farming that didn’t quite focus on overcoming new and greater challenges. 



In The Edge of Fate, Seasonal Bonus Power will now live right on your weapons and armor instead of on the Seasonal Artifact. By overcoming harder challenges in PvE (as customized by you)  or challenging yourself in Competitive and Trials for PvP, you can earn gear with greater amounts of Seasonal Bonus Power that will increase your level beyond the Power Cap. 



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt38c564fbb65107c0/68657e0d6357a99b38f1b1c3/character_inspection_screen_tooltip.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/tBzrNVz.jpeg)

There are no longer weekly limits on how much progress you can earn either, so your Power can climb for as long as you want to play. Just like Artifact Bonus Power before it, these Seasonal Bonus Power levels are limited to the current season, and any weapons or armor above the Power Cap will be back to 200 at the start of the next season. 



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blta5c587ccccca8387/68657e0d2094788abc11bfdc/weapon_inspection_screen_tooltip.png)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/VFwv4RC.png)
###Bonus Power and Rewards 


As with the climb to the Power Cap of 200, by increasing your Power level further with Seasonal Bonus Power, you will be able to earn even higher tiers of armor and weapons with even greater benefits. When The Edge of Fate first launches, you will be able to increase your Power as much as a total of 450. Earning high enough grades from Portal activities can give consistent growth all the way to 400. 



Total Power 400 to 450 rewards will at first come from newly upgraded Prime Engrams which drop with both higher Power and higher Gear Tier than your regular rewards. Achieving higher grades in portal activities improves your chances of finding Prime Engrams, which are also no longer limited by week. 



With the Ash & Iron major update later this season, you will be able to earn total Power all the way to 550. Regular rewards from Portal activities will be able to drop up to 500 total Power, and Prime Engrams will again award gear up to the Hard Cap of 550. Those who reach 500 Power will be rewarded with regular drops of the highest tier of weapons and armor: Tier 5. This gear comes with both unique aesthetic qualities and the highest stats, so being able to *consistently *farm them will be an aspirational journey for the most ambitious Guardians. 



And make sure to regularly check what's going on in the Portal! Challenges on the Seasonal Hub page and Events will both be a great way to get some bonus Power progression.  


###Infusion 


Infusion is a great way to increase the Power of your favorite items, but needing a constant supply of Upgrade Modules to do it was a hassle. We’re simplifying infusion to instead use Enhancement Cores directly, so you no longer need to make constant trips to Banshee. Any Upgrade Modules you may have in your inventory at the start of The Edge of Fate can be safely dismantled to reclaim 5000 Glimmer and one Enhancement Core (the same price that Banshee-44 and Ada-1 sold them for).



You can infuse levels of Seasonal Bonus Power into your favorite gear using a new currency called Unstable Cores. While you’ll find Unstable Cores from a variety of sources, the primary way to acquire them is by dismantling unneeded gear that has Seasonal Bonus Power levels. The higher the Bonus Power of the item you dismantle, the greater the number of Unstable Cores you’ll receive. Likewise, infusing items with a larger difference in Bonus Power levels will take more Unstable Cores. Unstable Cores will have a large inventory cap and will be refreshed at the start of the next season alongside Seasonal Bonus Power. 


###Quality of Life 


With The Edge of Fate, the Power climb should be more intuitive than ever before. Seasonal Bonus Power offers a refreshed player journey for the highest tiers of gear every season while keeping numbers understandable and meaningful.



The reward forecast for many activities will preview exactly what Power your reward will be when you reach the target score. With the new core game modifier system, you can even curate what kind of challenge you’re in for, allowing everyone’s Power journey to be uniquely tailored to how they want to play. Portal content will also feature new daily Bonus Focus rewards across both PvE and PvP, which allow you to target earning Power on gear for a specific slot that you might be missing to round out your average.  



Both account-wide Power progression and Fireteam Power (introduced in The Final Shape) will be sticking around as well, so your progress will carry over to all your characters and you can always play with your friends. 


##Economy Updates in The Edge of Fate


In The Edge of Fate, we’re taking a deep look at our core game activities in-game economies and rebuilding them along with the rest of the game. Core game activities (Solo Ops, Fireteam Ops, Pinnacle Ops, Crucible, and Trials of Osiris) will be your primary sources of Glimmer, Strange Coins, and Masterwork materials. These rewards will scale alongside your gear, with better rewards coming from higher difficulty content.



As you can see below, a lot is changing with this release and will continue to evolve over the coming seasons based on your feedback and analytics. Please, keep it coming!



[Image Link](https://images.contentstack.io/v3/assets/blte410e3b15535c144/blt5a63c6b313c9e19d/686632b6e8e8e6f8f15d1ccd/Consumable_FrontPageBanner_PC_1920x590.jpg)^^^[imgur](https://i.imgur.com/PtgXHTq.jpeg)
###Armor Masterworking


Along with Armor 3.0, Masterworking new pieces of armor will have their costs changed depending on the tier of the armor piece. In our Edge of Fate Reveal Stream, we mentioned that armor now drops with energy completely filled in, so players can begin to buildcraft immediately with armor mods. Masterworking armor is now focused on increasing stats. If you want to reach your full stat potential, you’ll want to fully Masterwork your armor!



The higher the tier, the more it costs. We want players to be able to engage with the Masterwork system without them worrying about “wasting” materials on lower tier gear. Additionally, armor now has five Masterwork levels rather than ten.



If you notice the costs for Tier 5 in the table below, don't worry just yet. We’re rebalancing the distribution of Masterwork materials pretty dramatically when The Edge of Fate arrives. Enhancement Prisms will become a bit more common than they were previously to better fit their role between Enhancement Cores and Ascendant Shards. In core game activities, you’ll also have a chance for major enemies to drop materials such as Masterwork materials. Maybe even some other goodies.



Here's a table with the costs of Masterworking every tier of Armor.


Gear Tier|Masterwork Level|Glimmer|Enhancement Core|Enhancement Prism|Ascendant Shard|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
1|1|300||||
2|500||||
3|1200||||
4|3500|1|||
5|4500|2|||
2|1|1200||||
2|2800|1|||
3|4000|1|||
4|5000|2|||
5|7000|2|1||
3|1|1500|1|||
2|3000|2|||
3|5000|3|||
4|7000|4|1||
5|8500|5|2|1|
4|1|200|2|||
2|3300|3|1||
3|6500|4|1||
4|8200|5|2|1|
5|10000|7|3|1|
5|1|2400|3|1||
2|3500|5|2||
3|7500|6|2||
4|9100|7|3|1|
5|12500|9|5|2|


Exotic Armor|Masterwork Level|Glimmer|Enhancement Core|Enhancement Prism|Ascendant Shard|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
1|1500|1|||
2|3000|2|||
3|5000|3|1||
4|7000|4|1|1|
5|8500|5|2|2|


Note that these changes apply only to new armor. Weapon Masterworking is unchanged from how it worked previously, even if it may be revisited in a future release.


###Destination Materials


Destination materials, which stopped dropping from resource nodes starting in The Witch Queen, and later only granted Glimmer and/or reputation, will be fully deprecated when The Edge of Fate arrives. Master Rahool will no longer accept Destination Materials, and they will no longer have any value.



This is the list of materials that can be safely deleted** after July 15**:



* Finest Matterweave
* Dusklight Shard
* Microphasic Datalattice
* Baryon Bough
* Helium Filament
* Glacial Starwort
* Spinmetal Leaves
###Activity Rewards Changes

####Vanguard Ops Onslaught


Onslaught has been rebuilt to be a part of the core game activity engine and will drop new tiered rewards. That means the older gear, the Brave Arsenal, needs to be moved to a different place so the loot pool only offers the new gear.



* Brave Arsenal weapons will be moved to be part of Xûr’s wares

   * Only the Standard (non-foil) versions of these weapons will be available.
* Zavala will no longer offer Onslaught attunement.
####Nightfalls


While Nightfalls will remain accessible from World tab in The Edge of Fate, they will no longer work on a weekly rotator, but on a daily one, and will include all current Nightfall Strikes and Battlegrounds. This required some changes to how the loot pool was delivered.



* Nightfall Weapons are now legacy gear.
* Nightfall loot pool will be updated to include all previous Nightfall weapons that have Origin Traits.
* Nightfall rewards are on a knockout list until all Nightfall weapons have been unlocked.

   * From then on, all Nightfall weapons have a flat drop chance.
* Grandmaster Nightfalls no longer exists, as their purpos
```

**Top Comments:**

**Comment #1** by u/DTG_Bot (1 points, 2025-07-03 14:02):
```
e and function have been transferred to the Portal screen and Conquests.

   * You will still experience Grandmaster difficulty, just in other activities.
####Legacy Rituals (Crucible, Gambit, Vanguard Ops)


Activities that don't offer tiered gear required some adjustments in the new system.



* Ritual Reputation Reward Tracks have been removed.
* Ritual Engrams have been removed.
* Legacy Focusing Remains but costs have been updated with the removal of Ritual Engrams.

   * Legacy Armor and Legacy Weapons will cost:

      * 15000 Glimmer
      * Three Enhancement Cores
##Vendors and Reputation Rank Tracks


When you start playing The Edge of Fate, you'll notice the vendor reputation system has been removed from vendors in the Tower, with the exception of Hawthorne. This new approach comes hand in hand with a rebalance of rewards throughout the game. Without going into too much detail, we can say that removing these reputation tracks allows us to be more rewarding with currencies and gear that drop from activities.



With that in mind, here's a list of additional changes coming to a fistful of vendors with the new expansion. We hope it helps you understand their new duties.


####Xûr


* Xûr will not sell Legendary armor in The Edge of Fate.

   * All of Xûr's Legendary armors will move to Ada-1 where she will sell them for cosmetic purposes.
* Xûr will now sell two Exotic armor pieces, per class, per week

   * One will be from the existing pool of Exotics that XVr has always sold.
   * One will be from the Beyond Light, Witch Queen, Lightfall, The Final Shape pools.

      * Players must own the expansion these Exotics are associated with in order to purchase them from Xûr.
   * Xûr will continue to sell catalysts but they have been moved to the Strange Gear Offers submenu.
   * Xûr will sell Exotic Class Items every week.

      * Players still need to acquire the Exotic Class item from Dual Destiny (or FOTL) before Xûr will allow players to purchase Exotic Class Items.
   * Xûr will sell 9 Legendary Weapons per week

      * Three weapons per slot
      * Class-specific Swords (which aren't class specific anymore) are still in Xûr's inventory but will not be available every week.
   * Xûr has had Brave Arsenal weapons added to his inventory.
   * Xûr has had Legacy Nightfall and Trials Weapons added to his inventory.

      * Rare Chance at Adept Weapons showing up.

         * Standard weapons will cost 17 Strange Coins.
         * Adept weapons will cost 41 Strange Coins.
      * Xûr has had weapons from Echoes, Revenant, and Heresy added to his inventory.

         * Rare Chance at Adept Heresy weapons.

            * Standard weapons will cost 17 Strange Coins.
            * Adept weapons will cost 41 Strange Coins.
         * Xûr has had Legacy Comp Crucible Weapons added to his inventory.
         * Xûr will no longer sell:

            * Nightfall Ciphers
            * Gambit Engrams
            * Crucible Engrams
            * Vanguard Engrams
            * Upgrade Modules
####Ada-1


We have already covered Ada-1’s new duties in previous TWIDs, but let’s have a reminder.



* Ada will be offering up to 20 Threader Bounties per season, per class.
* Ada's inventory of legacy armors has been expanded to include armors previously distributed via Xûr.

   * Legacy armor will cost:

      * 15000 Glimmer
      * Three Enhancement Cores
   * Ada will offer players who have made it to the Tower for the first time before The Edge of Fate a bundle of Exotic armor tokens to be used to roll for Exotic armors with new stat packages.

      * Players must have unlocked an item in collections before it is eligible for rerolls on Ada-1.
      * **These tokens are a one-time offer.**
      * These offers will disappear from Ada when all tokens have been spent.
      * No new armors will be added to this in the future, so there is no benefit to hording tokens.
   * Transmog Bounties have been overhauled.

      * PvE - Bounties that can be completed anywhere in PvE activities, **no longer** sends players to specific destinations (ie: Blind Well, Altars of Sorrow).
      * PvP - Bounties that can be completed in any PvP mode (Crucible, Trials, etc.)
      * Raids & dungeons - Unchanged from previous version.
####Banshee-44, the Gunsmith


* Reputation Rank Reward Track has been removed.

   * Bounties no longer provide Gunsmith Reputation.
   * Dismantling gear no longer provides Gunsmith Reputation.
* Banshee will no longer sell Upgrade Modules.
* Gunsmith Engrams have been removed from the game.
* Legacy weapons will cost:

   * 15000 Glimmer
   * Three Enhancement Cores
####Rahool, the Cryptarch


* Cryptarch Reputation Ranks have been removed.
* New Exotic Armors in The Edge of Fate will be unlocked via completing the Legendary Campaign and **NOT** through Rahool.

   * Unlocked Per Class
* Novel Focusing for Exotic Armors from **past expansions** will be available to players immediately, with no need to decrypt engrams to unlock it; costs remain the same for Novel Focusing.
* Focusing sub-menu has been reordered to put the most used screens up front.
###Ghost Mods


As we enter the world of Armor 3.0, where new stats have replaced some old ones, we need to make adjustments to Ghost mods, as some stats are no longer available and new ones have taken their spot. Similar situation with Nightfalls and other activities that have become Legacy content. Having mods for not up to date gear doesn't feel that rewarding, so we are removing those mods.



* Previous Armorer Ghost Mods (ie: Resistance Armorer) will be deprecated, as they no longer match the stats on Armors post v900.

   * They will replaced with a new set of Armorer Ghost Mods.
* Some Activity Ghost mods have been deprecated.

   * We plan to Add new Activity Ghost mods in a future release.
###Osirian Ciphers and Nightfall Ciphers


Osirian Ciphers and Nightfall Ciphers will not have a use in The Edge of Fate, but they will remain in your inventory, and we are not deleting them. We have plans for them in Destiny 2: Renegades and we will tell you all about it when our plans are more advanced.

I used to work in small town hospital now working in a big city kaiser hospital. One thing I noticed is everything is so uptight and regulated. For example when giving report they have their own format and procedures you have to do and you gotta sign off who you gave report to at the end, 2 RN insertion so a nurse watches you do insertion, use a b braun pump which is much slower and less freedom, every patients get a card and can rate their experience like whether they like you or not lol they turn it in at the end, patients can see your notes that you write generally the dont want you to write notes. There's much more. I am used to more freedom and less regulation.

Give report outside pt room, iv pump i can manipulate with more, etc... Is this how it is now?

That’s why Kaiser is running on float pool and travelers! Won’t staff the floor but lord do they stack that middle management on up! Sooooo much micromanaging and policing! Maybe pull some of those helicopter-mid-level managers back to the floor so we don’t have to take 8 person patient loads on med surge with 1 tech to 40 patients so we’re all doing primary care and looking for a second nurse to co-sign our insulins while the middle management sips on their free boxed Panera coffee while nodding their disapproval with clip board in hand. 

Bottom line… FUCK Kaiser and the CEO they rode in on!

Ask them to cut your potassium with saline if they haven't already. I remember potassium by itself felt like tabasco straight into the vein, but they were able to add saline to the line and it stopped it pretty much entirely (until the saline ran out in the middle of the night, haha).

*cross-posting on other relevant subs (pregnant, newparents, etc)* 

Hi all,

I'm a long-time lurker but rarely have time to come on anymore and read, much less comment or post. However since having my first child over 3 years ago and also my second a year and a half ago, I've been keeping notes on advice and product recommendations. I've taken to giving this out to friends and co-workers when I hear the happy news that they are expecting, so I thought I'd share it here as well in hopes it helps someone. Please take this with a grain of salt- I know everyone has different experiences! Please feel free to post your favorite advice or product recommendations as well if you want.

Take care, and enjoy your parenting journey!

# General advice:

I'm really going to try to keep cliché's out of here as much as possible and keep this to only practical advice that I wish someone had laid out for me. But cliché's exist for a reason- they are generally true!

* The first couple months after birth/with a newborn are the hardest, with the first couple of weeks being the toughest yet. It really gets easier! That being said, those first several weeks the only goal should be survival. Don't plan to do any house projects, if you know something will need to be done (like a car oil change,taxes, etc) do it before baby arrives if possible. Do everything you can to try to make those first few weeks as easy as possible. Set up the crib/bassinet (I was convinced we were going to have more time and had neither set up. I literally put the bassinet together myself while I was in labor). Those last few months of pregnancy when you cook, make extra and freeze it. I have several good freezer prep recipes if you're looking for some. Once baby is here don't worry about cleaning the house, etc. Just survive.
* Accept help, but on your own terms. Lots of times people come offering to watch the baby but sometimes as a new mom you just feel more comfortable having baby with you. People can still help by doing the cooking and/or cleaning so you don't have to. And if you want/get time away from baby don't feel like you need to do those chores- take that time for you to sleep/shower/whatever you need. Do not feel like you need to cater/entertain guests. Or if you know you will, don't invite or let them over. This is YOUR time to bond with baby and recover- guard your time.
* Everything is a phase. Soak up the good stuff while you can, and know that the not so good stuff won't last forever.
* You can never give your baby too much love. You can't "spoil" a baby by holding them too much. Especially the first 3 months (known as the "4th trimester")- remember that baby was used to being "held"/cuddled and fed 24/7 in your womb. So even if you're holding them for 16 hrs/day- that's still a significant decrease than what they are used to. I know it's exhausting, but try to soak up those cuddles.
* Remember to take videos as well as pictures- those little newborn noises are precious!
* If everyone is crabby and it seems like nothing is fixing it- try to change the environment. Get everyone outside- fresh air is good for everyone. I've tried to get baby outside for at least a little bit every day of his life since getting home from the hospital (yes, even during winter in WI). If outside isn't an option try a bath.
* Take all advice with a grain of salt (even this). You know your baby/family best!

# Pregnancy/Postpartum mama care:

* The "Expecting & Empowered" workouts were great. They have 3 guided workouts for each week of pregnancy to prepare you for labor and motherhood. Also follow them on IG. I give a lot of credit to them for my pretty easy pregnancy and deliveries!
* Once I started feeling sore later in pregnancy, prenatal yoga really helped me. I used an app called Prenatal Yoga by Down Dog that I really like. You have to pay for a subscription but I think you can try it for 30 days free, but I ended up paying for the subscription and actually re subscribed. They have a whole suite of apps that all fall under the same subscription - normal yoga, meditation, HIIT, and others. I think it's worth it, and I got the subscription on a black Friday deal for $24/year
* As far as labor goes- there’s so many resources and advice out there that could be a novel by itself. The only thing I’ll say is whatever your birth “plan” (if you have one)- just make sure it’s flexible and that your partner knows what it is and why so they can advocate for you. Once you’re in that pain it’s very hard to advocate for yourself.
* What I’ve learned is there is typically a sliding scale of interventions. Meaning- if you end up getting induced you’re more likely to end up getting a c-section. Ideally, you want to go into labor on your own. (when you’re ready to get that baby out, there are lots of myths out there and strategies to try. My advice- walking and sex).
* I’ve attempted 2 medication-free births but eventually gotten the epidural each time. If I have another baby I’m getting the dang epidural asap.
* So many postpartum care things to have on hand since you really won't know how your delivery will go. All the normal things like pads, and cooling pads, and peri bottle. I had a really easy birth experience so I didn't use a lot of the products I had so not much experience. But I did like the[ Honey Pot pads](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0787GLJB4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1) because they had a cooling effect that was pleasant but not overwhelming. I also liked having a[ sitz bath](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B088P9XTZV/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) and[ bath salts](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LF4BJ4C/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) to put in it.
* Fun postpartum symptoms to look forward to that no one warned me about (in addition to bleeding for 4-6ish weeks)- horrible cramping/contractions while the uterus shrinks the first week (especially happens when nursing) - hot pads and ibuprofen help, night sweats (waking up in the middle of the night to a crying baby drenched with sweat and freezing because you’re so wet), strong body odor (just, why?!), hair loss (this is why I cut all of my hair off after having baby). I’m sure there are others I’ve forgotten about. So many fun things! 

# Breastfeeding

I highly recommend trying to breastfeed if you're able. It does make the first few weeks (which are already hard) more challenging, but after that it's so much easier! You can go places without needing bottles/water/formula (all you need is you!). Plus, sterilizing and washing bottles all the time is a drag. Plus the bonding is really special (not that you can't get this without breastfeeding). But breastfeeding is always the #1 comfort technique if baby is cranky or sick, even if he's not hungry. A few tips/info:

* Stay hydrated!!! You can designate your partner that their job is to make sure you always have accessible water. And try to make sure you have water when sitting down to nurse, cause sometimes as soon as they start nursing you feel parched.
* The first few hours/days are critical to establishing your supply. Put baby to breast at a minimum every 3 hours (day and night, set an alarm) and more often if she's awake/fussy. After your milk comes in, assuming baby starts gaining weight again, your pediatrician should give you the okay to stop the alarm during the night and feeding on demand (which will likely still be pretty frequent).during the day you basically always want to be feeding them every 3-4 hours
* Invest in some nursing bras/tanks. I didn't- thinking I would later if breastfeeding worked out. But honestly you need to give it at least 1-2 months to give it a fair shot, and you can't go that long without having clothes that make it easy. We went and got some when baby was 3 days old. Would've been better to have in advance. Target has great stuff. I lived in the same 3 nursing tanks with 5 different flannel shirts over it for the first few months.
* Set up a breastfeeding station where you can be comfy and have things you might need. I love my glider chair, and put a cart with snacks, water (drink LOTS of water), phone charger, lotion, baby nail clippers (this was the easiest time for me to trim baby's nails), etc.
* Don’t pump the first 4ish weeks as this is when your supply is established, and the pump will make your body think it needs to produce more. An oversupply can be just a big of problem as an under supply.
* The tough thing with nursing is you really don't ever get a break. Even if someone else were to give baby a bottle (which I don't recommend for the first 4ish weeks for reason above)- you need to pump to keep your supply up. At that point, it's easier to just feed the baby yourself (in my opinion). To help with this during nighttime feedings, when Matt wasn't working he would basically do everything else minus the feeding (unswaddling, changing diaper, reswaddling, etc) and just hand baby to me to nurse to make it as easy as possible on me.
* I highly recommend getting a haakaa ([amazon link](https://smile.amazon.com/Breastpump-Silicone-Lip-Phthalate-100ml/dp/B07G43F123/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?dchild=1&keywords=haakaa&qid=1626209512&sr=8-3-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzQkZJNllPTTFFOTE1JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODMwMDMyMkZaSzIyT0lXSlhOSiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTY4MzAzM0hPN1FBSkhFMzlFMiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=)). When you are feeding baby on one side it triggers a let down, which can lose a lot of milk on the side baby isn't on. You can use this to capture that (plus a little more since it does suction, so you do want to be careful with this and not use it too frequently and create oversupply). I use it now after baby's long night stretch and both boobs are really full. I slowly built up a decent freezer stash using this without ever actually pumping. They also have milk collectors ([amazon link](https://smile.amazon.com/Nursing-Collector-Silicone-Extra-Flexible-Reusable/dp/B08534YF4W/ref=sr_1_8?dchild=1&keywords=haakaa&qid=1626209892&sr=8-8)) that has less suction, and you can wear these under your bra if you find you're leaking often. I got these as well but didn't really like them as much as I thought.
* You'll probably also want breast pads to catch leaking. For awhile I used the disposable ones, but eventually got these ([amazon link](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GPJ9V4Y/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) and like them.
* Read up on milk handling/storage. La Leche league ([website](https://www.llli.org/)) is a great resource. If you're looking for even more info- read "The womanly art of breastfeeding" written by La Leche league.
* Breastfeeding should NOT hurt! If it hurts- ask for help. Could be an issue with the baby's latch or something else, like a tongue/lip tie. Make sure before you leave the hospital you have someone look at your latch and tell you what to look for to make sure you get a good latch every time. Easier to correct earlier than later.
* That being said- for the first month-ish I had pain for about 4 seconds every time baby latched. Sounds like this is unusual as no other mom I talked to experienced this so hopefully doesn't happen to you. It eventually stopped- I think it was just my nipples getting used to the expanding. But I never had my nipples crack/bleed or anything. This is not expected/normal. Talk to someone if this is happening.
* Since you'll probably want baby to take a bottle eventually- you'll need to start this at some point. The recommendation that I've read multiple times is to wait until 4-6 weeks (after breastfeeding is fully established) before trying. Then you need to do it frequently- maybe a bottle a day. We started early and he did fine so eventually we got lazy and stopped for awhile because I didn't like pumping when he bottle-fed. Then when we started trying again in preparation for me returning to work he flat out refused and then it was much harder to persuade him back to the bottle. If this happens- the method that worked best for us was called "intermittent bottle by mom". Google it if you get in this position (or ask me questions at that point).
* Positions- at the hospital they only taught me the cradle and football hold for some reason. I later learned about the laid back position and at the time it was a game changer for me- I was so tired/sore of sitting up and hunching over for the middle of the night feeds. Laid back allowed me to be much more comfortable. Also side-lying- one of my favorite positions now.
* Breastfeeding doesn't have to be all or nothing. You can combo feed with formula if you want/need to. A fed baby and happy mama is the most important!

 

# Sleeping

Good luck! Just kidding. So much conflicting info out there on this.  I guess my number 1 tip here would be to read up on different strategies and have a plan. Being knowledgeable about different options is helpful if you need to pivot strategies in the middle of the night and you're running on very little sleep. Some questions for you to consider - will you bedshare (most families end up co-sleeping at some point. Good to know the Safe Sleep 7 in case you decide to)? Or room-share? Will you "sleep train" (which means different things to different people)? When they start getting decent stretches of sleep it is a game. changer. I will share some tips that seemed to have work for us. baby started sleeping through the night (7+ hr stretches) around 11 wks, and shortly thereafter started sleeping 10-11hr stretches. We do bed-share occasionally, even now if he wakes up between 5-6a I pull him into bed with me and nurse in a side-lying position and we both fall asleep for a bit longer. It's really lovely to be able to do this.

# Generic sleep advice

* I liked the book "The happiest baby on the block". It discusses the conditions in the womb, and how to recreate those as much as possible to soothe baby, especially during the 4th trimester. (spoiler- swaddle, "shhh"/white noise fairly loud (as loud as standing next to a shower), sucking on a pacifier, swaying (movement), oriented on baby's side).
* Some resources: TakingCaraBabies. You can follow on fbook/insta- they post great stuff. She also offers classes. We have all of her classes and really think it worked well for us, and we never felt like we were leaving baby to "cry it out" alone. We never let him cry for more than 5 min. She has a newborn class, one for 3-4 mo old, and then 5 mo+. I feel like each one supported baby where they were developmentally.
* Make the sleep space as conducive to sleep as possible- cool, white noise, and as dark as possible. Seriously- invest in blackout curtains/shades. (other than naps for the first few weeks which you want to keep light/noisy to help them establish their days/nights). Babies aren't scared of the dark, any light is just stimulation.

# 0-3 months

* Swaddles. Highly recommend swaddling. They just can't control their limbs at this age and they'll accidently jerk one and startle themselves awake. Swaddling helps with this, and makes them feel more like they are back in the womb which is comforting. So many parents say their baby hates the swaddle, and I don't know maybe they actually do, but baby would also struggle when we were putting him in the swaddle but then he would sleep so much better. We used the Halo ([amazon link](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07C8MVCSM/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)) and Nested Bean ([amazon link](https://smile.amazon.com/Nested-Bean-Zen-One-Classic/dp/B07ZJKT6KK/ref=sr_1_4_sspa?crid=2ETQXKVSRPZ9H&dchild=1&keywords=nested+bean+zen+sack&qid=1627394766&sprefix=nested+bean%2Caps%2C857&sr=8-4-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUExVE4xWEVNQVZDUlpZJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjgxODU5M0dCNktESVlOT0xOMyZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMDI2MDYwMU5IVk5QWktaM1JBMiZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=)). I liked the nested bean because it had the option of swaddling with hands up or hands down, it has the weighted bean on the chest which is comforting, and you can zip the sleeves off when you are ready to transition out of the swaddle. Although- the unzipping the sleeves didn't really work for us when we were trying to transition out, at that point we got the Magic Merlin Sleep suit ([amazon link](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B0095YYAW6/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?_encoding=UTF8&aaxitk=7d2dde2164ffce9d88ec0f08a2a88607&hsa_cr_id=4223834360501&pd_rd_plhdr=t&pd_rd_r=82d44040-fa08-4a35-bb3e-77ef2dc539ea&pd_rd_w=nQdWZ&pd_rd_wg=Im0Zk&ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_mcd_asin_0_img)) and that helped us transition out of the swaddle.
* Babies should sleep a lot. You can look up average sleep per day hours and wake windows based on baby's age. I think in baby's first few weeks he got really crabby in the evenings because we were letting him get overtired. I think in the first month the goal is that they aren't awake for more than an hour at a time. We were kinda just winging it and didn't realize we should be trying to get him down to sleep fairly soon. At this point- when they wake up you feed and change them and then basically start getting ready for sleep again. You really want to try to avoid an over-tired baby, and it happens really fast and easily.
* We had baby sleep in a sidecar bassinet so he was easy for me to grab/feed during the night. When he was around 3 months old we moved the bassinet away from the bed but still in the room so we weren't waking each other up as much.
* Just to set reasonable expectations - any sleep on their own in the bassinet is a win. Hopefully you can get some night sleep there, unlikely that any naps will happen there. We did all contact naps (meaning- holding, wearing, cuddling) for those months and started trying 1 nap/day when he was around 8 weeks in his crib. At that point any naps done in a crib is a huge win. And those will probably be short.
* Naps don't typically lengthen/mature until about 5 months old. This is normal and expected. It's good to have reasonable expectations so you're not upset with yourself/baby. It's easy to obsess over things as a mom. Don't let naps steal your joy! Try to enjoy those baby naps on you. Use it as a time to rest/relax yourself.

# 3mo+

* Bed time routine- important to establish a consistent routine. Same order of events, same place, and around the same time per day (we target between 7-8p). Our routine: bath (if it's bath night, which we do every 2-3 days), diaper, massage/lotion, jammies, nursing, burp, in crib for 2 books, then swaddle/merlin suit/sleep sack, turn on white noise, lay down in crib/bassinet awake with pacifier.
* Around this time we really saw a reduction in night wakings once we were able to put him down awake at bedtime and let him fall asleep on his own. Around this time their sleep pattern changes to be more like an adult- and we naturally wake up several times in the night to check out our surroundings and if all is well fall back asleep often without even knowing we were awake. Example I read- if I fall asleep in bed and awake in the night in a neighbor's bed that would cause me to fully wake up and scream/cry. Same thing with baby. If they fall asleep being rocked in your arms and wake up alone on the mattress that can be alarming. If they fall asleep on their own then when they wake up in the same environment all is well and they can go back to sleep.
* That being said- we weren't able to just go from nursing to sleep (which is what we did for the first few months) to being able to put him down awake right away. This took time/patience. We worked our way down the intervention scale- nursing to sleep, then rocking to sleep, rocking til drowsy but putting down awake then rocking in bassinet, etc.
* Around 3 months old we disconnected the sidecar bassinet and moved it across the room. Then around 4-5 mo we moved baby into his own bedroom in the crib. This worked for us but this timeline varies a lot so do what works for you

# What to do with baby when awake

Legitimate question that I hadn't considered until we were in the middle of it. In the first few weeks baby really doesn't have much awake time outside of eating/diaper changes. But here are some ideas:

* Baby wear and do whatever you want!
* Tummy time
* Massage
* Sing songs
* Get outside (but try to keep baby protected from sun)
* Read books

 

# Pumping/Milk Maintenence

* I love my pumpables genie advanced - normally $180. [https://pumpables.co/products/genie-advanced](https://pumpables.co/products/genie-advanced). I really like the liquid shield kids that go with these as well. These go on sale a couple of times throughout the year.
* For wearable collection cups- legendairy collection cups – normally $60. [https://www.legendairymilk.com/products/sillicone-collection-cups](https://www.legendairymilk.com/products/sillicone-collection-cups). These are nice when you want even more portability (I can pump with these in a coffee shop and no one can really even tell)
* I also had the Spectra that my insurance gave me, and it’s nice and has nice suction. But no portability.
* For the love of pete- measure your nipples and get the right size flanges!! I’m a size 17 and I think that’s the average, but for whatever reason a lot of breast pumps send larger sizes by default. 
* There’s lots of pumping bras but they never felt comfy to me. Ultimately my strategy was to wear nursing bras every day so I could nurse easily morning and evening and then do the nursing bra hack [(link to video)](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/Kg9VV-RQVug?feature=share) when pumping
* As far as schedule goes- for the most part I would pump 3 times during a work day. Obviously this is just a rough estimate and things change as time goes on. 
   * 6aish - baby wakes up and nurses on one side while I haakaa the other
   * 8:30 (after kids have left for daycare) - pump both sides
   * 11:30 - pump
   * 2:30 - pump
   * 5:30 - nurse baby
   * 7ish - nurse baby before bed
   * (once baby is sleeping through the night) 10pm - pump before going to bed
* I think there’s a “magic number” calculator you can google that helps you calculate the right number of times to pump/time to wait between to pumps based on different factors and if you want to decrease, increase, or maintain supply.
* During the day I always store my used pump parts in an air-tight container in the refrigerator between pumps and then deconstruct and wash them at night (recommend encouraging your partner to be the designated pump part washer every night). I think the CDC goes back and forth on whether this strategy is recommended, but I never had problems and I can’t imagine washing all the pump parts every single time.
* I always used the pitcher method - pump and then combine all the milk into a “pitcher” (I used a glass mason jar). I was lucky enough to be able to send my milk to daycare like this and she would pour from it to make the bottles. I know some daycares require pre-made bottles though.
* I would send fresh milk to daycare Tue-Fri of what I pumped the day before. On Friday I would freeze all pumped milk. On Monday I’d send a small amount of milk that I got from the haakaa over the weekend but otherwise baby would get thawed frozen milk that day (always the oldest in the freezer). This strategy was nice because mostly baby is getting fresh milk and you don’t have to constantly freeze everything, but you’re also still slowly working through freezer stash so things don’t get too old.
* On Fridays for freezing this is what I’d do:
   * Pour 4 oz into an easy-pour bottle (I froze in 4 oz increments but do whatever works best for you)
   * Pour into milk freezer bag (ie, lansinoh) - remove air bubbles (google tricks and you’ll find some videos to get rid of air bubbles)
   * Seal bag and place flat on cookie sheet
   * Repeat until all milk is bagged (depending on how much remaining milk I’d either freeze a smaller bag or leave it in the fridge and combine with haakaa milk over weekend)
   * Freeze the milk bags flat on the cookie sheet if possible (I have a chest freezer that I used)
   * Once frozen - transfer flat milk bags into gallon ziploc bags, layering from the bottom. I used the sit n stand bags. Once the gallon bag is full (I could fit 12 4-oz bags in) label it with dates and a number. 
   * On your freezer where you’re storing milk have a milk sign in/out sheet - (ie, bag #1 went in on 1/1/22 and was taken out 5/1/22).  This way when it’s time to take another frozen bag out you can look at the sheet and know which bag you’re looking for.

# Other resources/random notes

* Baby products are ridiculously expensive, and babies grow so fast they only use/wear things for very short periods of time. Highly recommend buying second hand or borrowing from friends when you can. I was all over facebook marketplace during my pregnancy.
* If you're looking for data-driven resources to read I recommend Emily Oster's two books- "Expecting Better" regarding pregnancy, and "Cribsheet" which is data on decisions from birth to preschool.
* Have a bucket with a color-safe laundry soaking option handy for soaking blow-outs or heavily spit-up items. You don’t want those to sit until you do laundry next
* We used an app to track diapers, feedings, and sleep. We used Huckleberry and liked it, but there are lots out there. For awhile the doctor will ask how many wet/dirty diapers they are having a day and there's no way I could remember that. And I also could never remember which side I breastfed last on. Or tracking sleep so I could make sure I was getting him down for naps at reasonable time. We felt this was very helpful for a bit, but after awhile it was stressing me out more than anything, and at that point we stopped using it. Use it if/as long as it seems helpful and then stop. Matt and I were both able to have it on our phones logged into the same account so we could both use it to log stuff
* It helps to have constant reminders of tips from parenting resources that line up with your parenting strategies. Some pregnancy/parenting instagram accounts I like:
   * Expecting & Empowered
   * Karrie Locher
   * Solid Starts - they also have an app with a database of foods and how to offer them to babies. Use this all the time
   * Biglittlefeelings
   * Kids.eat.in.color
   * Feedinglittles
   * Takingcarababies - sleep tips
   * Raisinggoodhumanspodcast- also listen to the podcast and really enjoy it
   * Dog meets baby
   * Milestones and Motherhood
* Once baby is in a crib- do the lasagna style bed sheet layering. Mattress protector > sheet > mattress progrector> sheet. This way if baby has an accident in the night (vomit, pee-through, excessive spitup) you can just pull off the top sheet/protector and you’re ready to go. So you need at least two mattress protectors and sheets!
* Baby wearing- as a newborn I carried baby everyday in a Solly wrap and we loved it. Once he had better head/neck control and he was more interested in looking out we got more structured carriers. I use a lillebaby now and we also have an ergo baby that Matt uses. We have them fitted to each of us so we don't have to adjust, and we got them both used from friends.
* Set up a subscribe & save for the [purple desitin](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZQXT4EY/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (highest zinc)
* Get a costco membership. Buy all the diapers there. (I believe the kirkland diapers are just re-branded huggies). Sometimes they are on sale- buy as many as you can.

# Product Recommendations/Baby Registry Ideas

I mentioned at the beginning but want to reiterate- baby products are expensive and they typically aren’t used for long. Highly recommend looking to get second hand when possible - friends, thrift stores, facebook marketplace, etc. Also- definitely make baby registries because you typically get a completion discount at a certain date to buy things off the registry at a discount (typically 15%). I usually make at least an amazon and target registry for each pregnancy and then maximize those registry discounts. Also- Bullseye Deals on Ebay is a reseller of target stuff (mostly new but also used so look before buying) at a discount!

* Tubby Todd all over ointment. I use this all the time on baby- helps with baby acne, dry patches, drool rashes, etc.
* We never bought a pack n play, figuring we would buy it if/when we needed it and we never have. I ended up buying a travel crib instead for traveling where we wouldn't have a crib (to Turks and Caicos). Both sets of grandparents had a pack n play we use when visiting, and most hotels offer them too. But when we actually needed one I was glad to take a travel crib instead of a pack n play (more portable and more comfortable for baby). Really like ours-[ Lotus Travel Crib](https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B00AKKDSNG/?coliid=IDUILCMBKZL0H&colid=ACCIZB6FRBGJ&psc=1&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it)
* Baby monitors - I do NOT recommend the nanit. We got it with baby and it was nice for the first year, but then after a year they hide all of the useful features behind a hefty subscription. This made me angry since the camera already is expensive. Plus at the time it didn’t support monitoring two babies but I think they’ve added that since then so that’s probably moot. We use a VTech camera monitor now that has two cameras and can monitor both kids at the same time.
* In addition to the camera monitor we also have cheap[ audio-only monitors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JEV5UI8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) in each kids room that we keep next to our bed (so audio only monitors stay in our bedroom just for during the night, then we have the video monitor on our main level for during the day).
* Snoo bassinet. For our first I swore I would never spend this much money for a product that would only be used for a few months. 1 month into our second and I broke down and got one for the hope it would help us sleep even just a little bit more. It worked for us! 
* Baby shoes (once walking)- we love stride rite shoes for early walkers. You want a soft-soled shoe while they are learning to walk (or bare foot is best when safe!). You also want a shoe with a wide toe-box so their toes have room to splay out like they should. Croc Classic clogs are also great little kid shoes especially for summer/water and really hold up (they have a much wider toe box than the Native brand shoes).
* [Kamik winter boots](https://www.amazon.com/Kamik-Girls-Snowbug-Snow-Toddler/dp/B0B74CG4JF/ref=sr_1_8?crid=13YC6L4VLC9V0&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.XG9d4Q4E23BSBAza8e5f_znVcjo8lfRf2-Tx3HaMMzcFNNe7xk72H_-NoMXC1Ck1ZSCQdElwdqiqnG014MGDCloBHCzlTRbNgC6AhNNOIuZ6lbObeGyfYjhYlRsA4j4kC-LIjiPMp1LAS48nmhOiw5ClrvNpbrVALJ-o0GJCct6cZmdH-lLl67tuJcU2vvjoQRs9WtgOH7C0bt7YVfCbfBZ3e0Q-M9-q1thV__XKCVshL6U00pTfpFEN-ivUijgWIOyhjqckaeqIFJYzEOks7j51IoHZPVKXMhL4-X9X6iM.JXU2mBIfRqoQQ9EEb691reYkeaI-q6CpI3ckqLKNOLY&dib_tag=se&keywords=kamik%2Bwinter%2Bboots%2Bkids&qid=1711992919&sprefix=kamik%2Caps%2C142&sr=8-8&th=1&psc=1) for toddlers are the best boots that I’ve found- easy to put on (this is key!) and warm and dry.
* [These are the best baby socks.](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PVXG5SW/ref=br_dsk_yr_itemdt_dp?colid=1DTCG83DTGX59&coliid=I1FOAIN9CNDYU8&psc=1) None of the other ones we’ve tried stay on, and the grippies are key once they start walking. 
* Sun safety: [Sunday Afternoons sun hats](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0823F38KZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) are the best. [ThinkBaby sunscreen](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KVNC2FC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is what we’ve used and trust (Thinksport is the same thing and sometimes cheaper). Although these [Babyganics sunscreen sticks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H48JXNG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) are also nice to have in diaper bags. These [refillable roll-on sunscreen applicators](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B8VTG317/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) are also kinda nifty.
* Absolutely love these [diaper cream applicators](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016SE0XB2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1) (we call them the butt spatulas).
* Bath time safety: you need [these cushions](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B081T5449V/ref=br_dsk_yr_itemdt_dp?colid=1DTCG83DTGX59&coliid=I1IOAL3KP0133O&psc=1) and [spout cover.](https://www.amazon.com/Skip-Hop-Spout-Cover-Universal/dp/B07D98DLDV/ref=sr_1_6?crid=2QC2I15MEZHHP&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.UAyvIbqwb1AnSWD_e0-cj4eAWGSAwG3ppocy3ZZUanKbm7XvAQasN7z0FfJhFje_NxFNrOXfVqasLk6nBhjprZ_pJG0fqVftfpARiueqtqxANVMkB1yQoxaO-v16MwWkekU02MZc8MpZv3S9nvYET9WVKFG1afC6OBSNK11s2bz5HaiwCLoVBrWvo5VrHXw65q7u66KzP_tXUuv45sZbgRH7t2hBBAaqoUc1CDhDhfETLScfAMQP0rHYkwJoxcHq4Q4aFguzG4EF6ksjzblwg1C-p6DD6sgw2yUWRx-Ujew.EEeR1eTS0a9wO3aqIES9pVyAIAfXyFpu4BBOwDsNrpw&dib_tag=se&keywords=bath+faucet+cover+for+kids&qid=1711989223&sprefix=bath+fa%2Caps%2C248&sr=8-6) 
* Car seats: I definitely recommend getting an infant car seat for the first year-ish as it’s just so much easier to lug baby around in an infant car seat as opposed to a bigger convertible car seat (infant car seats click out of the car so if baby falls asleep or whatever you can leave them in the seat. They can also click into strollers or other things). Convertible car seats are bigger and stay in the car.
   * I don’t have a strong recommendation for infant car seats- we used the Chicco keyfit system and have no complaints. If baby will be transported in multiple cars then ideal to get multiple bases.
   * Once baby outgrows the infant car seat (or you’re just ready to move on)- I highly recommend getting a revolving convertible car seat. The revolving feature is so clutch and makes it so much easier to get kids in/out! When I got ours these were pretty new to the market so there weren’t many options, but I got the [Evenflo Revolve 360](https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo0MzYxOTA1NzgyOTgyMDkxOjE3MTE5OTMyODc6c3BfYXRmOjIwMDEyNTUxNDI5ODk5ODo6MDo6&url=%2FEvenflo-Revolve-Extend-Revere-Convertible%2Fdp%2FB0BL1L24DS%2Fref%3Dsr_1_1_sspa%3Fcrid%3DELMBWU4NZX1C%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9E6khCmmUm4cF8payliiilZYhPQGQDi7XKib7OSLmHOtN-J1u9Tg67o1M7nYgslO47UXIMAVu9k7OlU-GrYVHdmv57xpBtE74mJjkdBaNtxPyxeFp_kqlU6imIRqIik9uCE_Wpk-RrhyvgX9LFrIHYRn8AoeTSB7sz2EqOFoc8d1tv0r_vsUO_WJXk6_JGl8nXYukMjruzjdt8eWNfkUZ0E6JDX2l9ZnxJppf3Drii3OmBy6abFyz7xgcJ3o736Hv5w52-rbOii7nsKEq7c9fhfdhggVpMgAbFaq_856Mxg.fOvhSZJ_bPMV-I5pkvASxHf1X2-dqlQYzIjRtnOysAk%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Devenflo%2Brevolve%2B360%26qid%3D1711993287%26sprefix%3Devenflo%252Caps%252C126%26sr%3D8-1-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1) and have no complaints. Love it. These revolve ones are certainly expensive, but they do go on sale periodically (especially black friday!). Key things to look for: 
      * high rear-facing weight and height limits. Ideally keep kiddos rear-facing as long as possible because it’s safer, so having a car seat with higher limits makes that possible. 
      * Fabrics/covers that are washable
      * Ideally 4 in 1 or at least 3 in 1 so it converts to a booster and kids can use it longer.
* Diaper bags are super personal preference, but after trying a couple I love my jujube ones hands down more than any other. They are pricey but go one sale on amazon sometimes. 
* Get a [quality thermometer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07F4JJH1Z/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I’ve tried several but this is the winner. I believe docs recommend rectal ones for the first year, but personally I like the ear ones like this. Braun is what they use in the doctors offices I believe. 
* Cups: When you start offering solid foods you typically also start offering water. We use the [Munchkin weighted straw cups](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L4DHNVK?ref=nb_sb_ss_w_as-reorder_k0_1_13&amp=&crid=G1DW6KINAO0L&sprefix=weighted%2Bstra&th=1) for water. Once they are done with bottles (around a year) we use the [Munchkin 360 training cup](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MRZIFD0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) for milk.
* You’ll need bibs when kiddo starts eating - recommend [silicone ones.](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08GFCX964/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o08_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
* The [Nose Frida snotsucker](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RP0GHBO/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) is certainly effective and I’ve always been glad to have it when I need it, but be prepared to get sick also.

I’ve been getting alot of pumps down with a complaint of “danger of free flow error”. When we test them in the shop we cannot duplicate the issue so they get released again. Knee-jerk reaction is to call it user error, but has anyone experienced this and found a culprit and a solution to fix it?

If memory serves, there was a recall issued by BBraun on that error several years ago.  Might be worth contacting OEM to see if those serial numbers are affected and if the recall was performed on them.

Something to do with the free-flow clip which gets inserted inside the pump. Possibly user error or liquid got inside and is bugging that sensor. 

I used to send these to Elite Biomedical. They do flat rate repair for $500. If you send one in have them replace the P2 port if it’s all corroded.

My hospital recently started using BBraun Infusomat IV pumps and I've noticed that the air detectors are extremely sensitive. They get triggered by even the the tiniest of bubbles. We have already had incidents where pumps that were infusing norepinephrine/vaso/dobutamine at pretty high doserates were stopping multiple times an hour due to teensy air bubbles. Does anyone with more experience on these pumps have tricks for preventing this from happening?

Edit: Looks like I dodged a bullet just by not having Alarises. Imma count my blessings.

Not this particular type but sometimes our Alarises are painfully sensitive in the same way you mentioned. Other than giving the line a good shake/flick (time allowing), one trick I found works is opening the pump up, pulling the line out and rubbing an alcohol swab along the length of the inside of the pump (especially focusing on the air sensor). This may be purely anecdotal and coincidental that it seems to work better after but just my $0.02!

My whole hospital system just switched to the BBraun large infusion infusomat space IV pumps. We have had nothing but problems since they rolled them out. Has anyone used them and liked them?? We’re now being told we can’t set them up with secondary tubing and to run all of our meds via primary programming because of problems that have occurred…. 

Anyone have anything positive to say about them?? I just want the alaris pumps back 😭

Coming from JHH that used Alaris to UMMC that just switched to B Braun has made me realize that I was unfair in criticizing Alaris pumps. 

 The fact that they tell us to have a second backup infusion pump for vasopressors in case the pumps don't infuse tells you alot. 

Lastly, the fact that you have to rotate the pump sideways to even infuse vancomycin :/

Drop kicking them is too kind for them. I feel like a slow melting down of them and sell the 4 ounces of metal in them for scrap is better

I will never work at another facility that uses these pumps. These are straight up dangerous. My hospital switched to these from plum pumps and the company keeps trying to gaslight us saying no one else has these issues.

Hey, I have an Infusomat Space Pump Failing its Downstream Occlusion pressure test going over by 2-3 PSI than tolerance, I went through and checked all the easy test errors, like making sure my DPM was zeroed correctly and that my test setup was right. The SVC manual doesn't have any recommendations where to go from here with troubleshooting, Does anyone have any recommendations, or which part it could be to order?

Hello everyone, I hope you are all well.

Forgive me for what may seem like a silly question, but I am wondering what everyone’s process is when their patient’s IV therapy has finished, or at least when the pump believes VTBI has been fully infused. I find that when the pump is alarming to say that it’s done, there is usually a little left in the chamber and line. I’ve had mixed opinions from colleagues in my unit when I’ve approached them to ask for their thoughts. We use the B Braun infusomat pumps.

Some think that it’s only about ~25mL, give or take, and can just be discarded. Some think the patient should receive that last bit. I am in agreement with that, I think they should get that last bit, since that would be the full dose that was charted. Especially if it’s an IVAB or something. However I am also getting mixed opinions on how to actually give this last little bit to the patient.

Some nurses have said they increase the VTBI on the pump by a little bit at the start, some have said they bolus it to the patient (which the pump alarms and says ‘make sure patient is disconnected’). Some say they will take the line out of the pump and essentially gravity feed it. I think I am just concerned that with any of these methods there is a risk to the patient, and I’d like to know everyone’s general processes or thoughts on if and how they administer the last bit of IVT to their patient.

Thank you in advance!

I dial it up to add the extra volume.. never change the rate as there are reasons Drugs have set rates. Also I’ll always then do a saline flush afterwards at the same rate that the drug was
```

**Comment #2** by u/Gold_Blacksmith_9821 (7 points, 2025-08-23 01:15):
```
Are you taking about giving intravenous medications or just fluids because the answer is very different? If medication, then  flush with compatible fluid the volume of the giving set( it should be listed on the packaging) If it’s just IVT such as 1 litre of CSL or 0.9% normal saline they get the volume minus giving set.  This is for adult patients only.
```

**Comment #3** by u/Pinkshoes90 (3 points, 2025-08-23 02:25):
```
Hang a flush and flush through 20mL for IVAB after the infusion is complete.

For fluids, take it down when the pump says it’s completed. If they’re on a strict FBC, document the infusion amount less the giving set volume. 

If they’re not, that 20mL is not going to make a difference.
```

**Comment #4** by u/AnyEngineer2 (3 points, 2025-08-23 04:00):
```
flush 20ml. would only discard without flush if it was eg a crystalloid bolus
```

**Comment #5** by u/whoorderedsquirrel (2 points, 2025-08-23 03:23):
```
1. Burp the bag when u prime the line so it can't run dry 

2. Add reconstituted IVAB volume to VTBI (so instead of running 100ml, u run it 120ml)

3. Pump will alarm when it's done as an upstream occlusion, the bag is dry but the line is still primed

4. You can either hang a 50/100ml IVT bag to flush what remains in the line, I usually run 20ml. OR if u have IVT shortages, scrub the existing (now empty) bag port and inject 20ml saline into it 

5. Run pump again for 20ml 

6. Disconnect lin, flush IVC , cap it. 



If u use the Alaris guardrail drug menu , it might not let u add onto the VTBI. I just wait for it to run 20-30ml thru then stop the infusion, put the VTBI back to 100ml and then it'll run to the end as normal

IBM has discovered a cybersecurity vulnerability that could potentially allow hackers to remotely take control of insulin pumps and alter medication dosages to patients, as well as "manipulate" readings from medical device monitors "to cover up concerning vital signs or create false panic."

X-Force Red, IBM's hacking team, last week for the first time publicly [**reported**](https://securityintelligence.com/posts/new-vulnerability-could-put-iot-devices-at-risk/) a problem with modules from French aerospace company Thales used in millions of internet-connected devices in the auto, energy, and healthcare industries. Using a flaw in the module, or mini circuit board that enables mobile communication, criminals could cause an insulin pump to overdose a patient. Neither IBM nor Thales have disclosed which manufacturers' pumps are vulnerable.  

IBM said it first identified the vulnerability in September 2019 and both companies worked on a patch available to device manufacturers since February. Still, IBM warned that the patching process is considerably slower for highly-regulated industries like medtech.

The disclosure follows another major announcement earlier this year regarding cybersecurity loopholes potentially impacting millions of IoT devices across a range of industries. In June, Israeli research laboratory JSOF [**discovered**](https://www.jsof-tech.com/ripple20/) multiple vulnerabilities, dubbed Ripple20, enabling hackers to potentially change the "behavior" of infusion pumps remotely, according to an example given by the lab.  

At the time, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued an advisory that [**listed**](https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/257161) medtechs Baxter and B. Braun as being "affected" by the Ripple20 vulnerabilities.

An IBM spokesperson said it isn't aware of "any exploits" of the vulnerability at this time and "cannot speak to specific devices using the impacted module" but did confirm that Thales’ portfolio of Internet of Things modules are used across various industries. MedTech Dive reached out to Thales but did not receive a response.

Last week, in response to the separate IoT device flaw publicly reported by IBM, CISA's Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center put out an analyst [**note**](https://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2020/08/hc3-analyst-note-tlp-white-thales-modules-vulnerability-cve-2020-15858-aug-19-20.pdf) but could not say what specific medical devices or companies have been impacted by the Thales modules.

"While this vulnerability potentially affects millions of IoT devices, it is unknown exactly how many devices are impacted in the \[healthcare and public health\] sector. Despite this, it is likely that internet-connected medical devices have a Thales module for network communication given its widespread use," the warning said. The note cited a June CISA [**advisory**](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsma-20-170-04) regarding Baxter Sigma Spectrum Infusion Pumps and noted that such medical devices are "already vulnerable to similar attack."

MedTech Dive reached out to Baxter to find out if its pumps are potentially impacted by the Thales module vulnerability but did not hear back from the company.

We have a comprehensive preset Drug Library at my facility and my understanding of the pump’s settings is limited. 



Can someone explain how I might use the Pressure (up and downstream) settings in a clinical scenario?
For eg, if a patient had a cannula that flushed well and tolerated ‘thin’ meds (IVABs, Hartmanns) without incident. With Albumin 20% the Pressure High alarm is constantly triggered. Could I adjust the pressure in this instance? 



The situation is hypothetical, I’d just like to increase my understanding.

An analysis of data from more than 200,000 network-connected [infusion pumps](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/general-hospital-devices-and-supplies/infusion-pumps#:~:text=An%20infusion%20pump%20is%20a,homes%2C%20and%20in%20the%20home.) used in hospitals and healthcare entities has revealed that 75% of those medical devices contain security weaknesses that could put them at risk of potential exploitation. The threats included exposure to at least one of 40 known cybersecurity vulnerabilities. For those who may not know, infusion pumps are the IV systems that deliver fluids, medications, and nutrients to patients. 

### The Threats and Vulnerabilities

The Palo Alto Networks threat intelligence team said it obtained the scans from seven medical device manufacturers. On top of that, 52.11% of all infusion pumps scanned were susceptible to two known vulnerabilities that were disclosed in 2019 as part of 11 flaws collectively called “[URGENT/11](https://thehackernews.com/2019/07/vxworks-rtos-vulnerability.html)“: 

* [**CVE-2019-12255**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12255) (CVSS score: 9.8) – A buffer overflow flaw in the TCP component of Wind River VxWorks.
* [**CVE-2019-12264**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-12264) (CVSS score: 7.1) – An issue with incorrect access control in the Dynamic Host Control Protocol (DHCP) client component of Wind River VxWorks.

Other important flaws impacting infusion pumps are listed below:

* [**CVE-2016-9355**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-9355) (CVSS score: 5.3) – An unauthorized user with physical access to an Alaris 8015 Point of Care unit may be able to disassemble the device to access the removable flash memory, allowing read-and-write access to device memory
* [**CVE-2016-8375**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-8375) (CVSS score: 4.9) – A credential management error in Alaris 8015 Point of Care units that could be exploited to gain unencrypted wireless network authentication credentials and other sensitive technical data
* [**CVE-2020-25165**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-25165) (CVSS score: 7.5) – An improper session authentication vulnerability in Alaris 8015 Point of Care units that could be abused to perform a denial-of-service attack on the devices
* [**CVE-2020-12040**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12040) (CVSS score: 9.8) – Cleartext transmission of sensitive information in Sigma Spectrum Infusion System
* [**CVE-2020-12047**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12047) (CVSS score: 9.8) – Use of hard-coded FTP credentials in Baxter Spectrum WBM
* [**CVE-2020-12045**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12045) (CVSS score: 9.8) – Use of hard-coded Telnet credentials in Baxter Spectrum WBM
* [**CVE-2020-12043**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12043) (CVSS score: 9.8) – Baxter Spectrum WBM FTP service remains operational after its expected expiry time until it’s rebooted
* [**CVE-2020-12041**](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12041) (CVSS score: 9.8) – Baxter Spectrum Wireless Battery Module (WBM) permits data transmission and command-line interfaces over Telnet

It doesn’t stop here with the vulnerabilities. Believe it or not, 2 years later in Nov. 2021 [Forescout](https://forescout.com/) completed a different project examining medical devices (not infusion pumps) and identified 13 new TCP/IP vulnerabilities in medical devices calling this research project the [Nucleus:13](https://www.forescout.com/blog/new-critical-vulnerabilities-found-on-nucleus-tcp-ip-stack/). Do we not learn from history? It’s more likely that manufacturers and hospitals simply ignore these risks.

### What Does This Mean?

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in leakage of sensitive patient information and allow an [attacker](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/hacker/) to gain unauthorized access to medical devices like infusion pumps. In 2021, McAfee [disclosed](https://thehackernews.com/2021/08/bbraun-infusomat-pumps-could-let.html) security vulnerabilities affecting B. Braun’s ‘Infusomat Space Large Volume Pump’ and ‘SpaceStation’ that could be abused by malicious parties to tamper with medication doses without any prior authentication.

Essentially, these unpatched or unsupported systems are open to being exploited by hackers. If they can control the infusion pumps, they can control a patient’s fate by changing the amount of medication being delivered into their bloodstream, or preventing them from receiving fluids. In theory, hackers could kill patients remotely through overdosing or restricting life-saving medications.

If you’re an SMB working in Healthcare, this next section will provide you with ideas on how to mitigate and minimize the risks you face to your medical devices and patients. If you’re not operating in Healthcare, skip to the “additional cybersecurity recommendations” section below.

### What Should Hospitals and Healthcare Entities Be Doing?

The discovery by researchers shows how critically vulnerable certain aspects of the healthcare industry are. With the results of these attacks potentially being deadly, it’s vital healthcare facilities are doing everything they can do to prevent attacks on these systems and healthcare-related systems not mentioned. 

There are six main areas of risk to medical devices today.

1. **Legacy Devices and Operating Systems (OS)**: medical devices are like computers. Vendors stop supporting old equipment and expect hospitals to upgrade to new equipment and new OS’ on a time scale. Hospitals need to track unsupported equipment and OS’ and replace them on a schedule.
2. **Patching**: using the computer analogy, even supported medical devices need fixing and patching during their lifespan. Make sure you have a [Vulnerability Alert Management Process (VAMP)](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/vulnerability-alert-management-policy-vamp/) in place, to make clear decisions on when to jump on a patch for a given vulnerability or exposure.
3. **External Communications Exposure**: medical devices communicate over TCP/IP networks. As shown by security researchers, first Palo Alto networks, then 2 years later by Forescount, vulnerabilities in these old TCP/IP stacks are rampant and must be examined, tested, and patched. Limiting your external network and communications exposure to prevent attacks on your medical devices is a must.
4. **Insecure and Unencrypted Protocols**: When you mail a letter, you seal it so that everyone in between can’t read your message. That’s what encryption provides in protocols that manage devices. A command issued by a Doctor, cannot be tampered with and changed when it travels over encrypted secure protocols. Trouble is, some medical devices talk with unsealed envelopes, allowing hackers to modify the requests along the way. Imagine changing the dosage of morphine for a patient from 5mg to 50 mg. Death would be swift, but painless.
5. **Default, Weak, Hardcoded Passwords**: CyberHoot has written about the [Internet of Things](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/internet-of-things-iot/) and weaknesses in passwords to manage them. Medical devices are IoT devices and often contain poor password hygiene. Device manufacturers need to learn from Wi-Fi device makers and imprint unique strong passwords on each device instead of default, weak, and reused passwords.
6. **Effective Segmentation**: Finally, hospitals would be wise to segment their medical device networks from all other traffic. There’s no reason someone reading an email on a hospital computer who gets infected by Malware from a phishing attack, should then have access to a medical device network. Segment everything and protect yourself. Think of a submarine vs. the Titanic and you’ll understand network segmentation instantly.

**Additional Cybersecurity Recommendations**  


Additionally, these recommendations below will help you and your business stay secure with the various threats you may face on a day-to-day basis. ***All of the suggestions listed below can be gained by hiring CyberHoot’s vCISO Program development services.***

1. Govern employees with policies and procedures. You need a password policy, an acceptable use policy, an information handling policy, and a written information security program (WISP) at a minimum.
2. Train employees on how to spot and avoid [phishing attacks](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/phishing/). Adopt a Learning Management system like CyberHoot to teach employees the skills they need to be more confident, productive, and secure.
3. Test employees with Phishing attacks to practice. CyberHoot’s Phish testing allows businesses to test employees with believable phishing attacks and put those that fail into remedial phish training.
4. Deploy critical cybersecurity technology including [two-factor authentication](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/two-factor-authentication/) on all critical accounts. Enable email SPAM filtering, validate backups, deploy DNS protection, [antivirus](https://cyberhoot.com/cybrary/antivirus-software/), and anti-malware on all your endpoints.
5. In the modern Work-from-Home era, make sure you’re managing personal devices connecting to your network by validating their security (patching, antivirus, DNS protections, etc) or prohibiting their use entirely.
6. If you haven’t had a risk assessment by a 3rd party in the last 2 years, you should have one now. Establishing a risk management framework in your organization is critical to addressing your most egregious risks with your finite time and money.
7. Buy Cyber-Insurance to protect you in a catastrophic failure situation. Cyber-Insurance is no different than Car, Fire, Flood, or Life insurance. It’s there when you need it most.

All of these recommendations are built into CyberHoot the product or CyberHoot’s vCISO Services. With CyberHoot you can govern, train, assess, and test your employees.

Diabetes refers to a group of metabolic disease characterized by high blood sugar level. Diabetes occurs due to inadequate secretion of insulin inside the pancreas. Some of the common symptoms for diabetes are frequent urination, excessive thirst, increased hunger, weight loss and tiredness. Type 1, type 2 and gestational diabetes are three types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease occurred due to high blood glucose level whereas, type 2 diabetes is a lifelong chronic diseases caused due to excess secretion of insulin inside the body. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system is activated against self-insulin producing cells. This results into low production of insulin and also disrupts blood glucose homeostasis. In type 1 diabetes, exposure to viral infection such as mumps and coxsackie viruses results into pancreas damage which results into low insulin secretion.

Type 1 diabetes is highly prevalent in young people and children whereas type 2 diabetes is common type of diabetes. Some of the common symptoms for type 2 diabetes are overweight, high blood pressure and high triglycerides. Diabetes is treated with the help of insulin delivery devices and drugs. Diabetes diagnostic devices includes analog blood meter, test strips, lancets and lancing devices whereas, insulin delivery devices includes insulin syringe, insulin pump, insulin pen and insulin jet injectors. Severe problems such as blindness, kidney failure, coronary heart disease and strokes may result due to lack of proper treatment.

North America is dominating the global type 1 diabetes market due to rising prevalence of diabetes. The U.S. is dominating the North American diabetes market. Asia Pacific region is expected to show high growth rate due to rising aging population in coming five years.

In recent time there is increased use of insulin delivery devices due to rising number of chronic diseases associated with diabetes. Rising awareness among people and technological advancement in insulin delivery devices are some of the key factors driving the growth of the global type 1 diabetes market. In addition, increasing government initiatives for diabetes control is also fuelling the growth of the global type 1 diabetes market. However, high cost of diagnosis and treatment is restraining the growth of the global type 1 diabetes market. In addition, unfavorable reimbursement policies are also inhibiting the growth of the global type 1 diabetes market.

Drugs can be administered directly into the body through injections, infusion, or through other drug delivery devices. Drug delivery devices are the devices or formulations used to inject therapeutic substances in the body through a specific route of administration, which depends on the type of disease, desired effect, and available products. Various drug formulations such as insulin and antibiotics are administered through drug delivery devices. These devices help in increasing the efficiency of the drug delivery system by controlling time, dosage, and place of release of the drugs in the body. Drug delivery devices may be conventional or implantable. Infusion pumps such as ambulatory infusion pumps, insulin infusion pumps, implantable infusion pumps, enteral pumps, and volumetric infusion pumps are some of the drug delivery devices used to administer drugs in medical systems. Infusion catheters such as valves, IV sets, needles, and cannulas are also used for drug delivery. Transcellular and paracellular routes are the routes commonly used to administer drugs. Hospitals, long-term care facilities, and home care providers are the main users of drug delivery devices.

Currently, North America leads the global drug delivery devices market, followed by Europe. This is due to increasing demand for improved drug delivery systems, rising accessibility and affordability of drug delivery devices, and increasing number of chronic diseases in the region. In the next five years, Asia is expected to be the fastest growing market due to rising prevalence of various chronic diseases and aging population in this region. Moreover, the improving economic conditions in the region are also expected to support the growth of the drug delivery devices market in Asia.

Rising geriatric population, technological advancements, and increasing demand for improved drug delivery systems are the key factors driving the growth of the global drug delivery devices market. Also, the improving healthcare facilities in various countries such as China, India, and Brazil are also fuelling the growth of this market. However, strict regulatory requirements for approval of drug delivery devices and lack of skilled and trained professionals to administer drugs are restraining the growth of the global drug delivery devices market. Moreover, problems related to the use of drug delivery devices such as dosage error are also hampering the growth of this market.

Rising cases of needle stick injuries, the shift in demand towards ambulatory surgical centers and fusion pumps, and a greater number of surgical procedures performed are poised to benefit the IV equipment market. Furthermore, a prevalence of chronic diseases in an ageing population in developed nations are positive signs for the IV equipment market. However, lack of wireless connectivity, regulatory mandates for new product launches and increasing cases of medication errors inhibit the unencumbered growth of the IV equipment market that is anticipated to witness a steady CAGR of 5% from 2017 to 2022.

An ageing population suffering from chronic diseases, particularly in developed regions, is anticipated to demand ever-more surgical procedures. IV therapy is one of the best choices available and this should benefit companies in the IV equipment market. Strong economic growth in Latin America and APEJ are expected to provide significant growth opportunities for companies actively involved in the IV equipment market. Nonetheless, rising prevalence of medication errors, strict regulatory requirements for new equipment and the absence of wireless connectivity in surgical centers and hospitals could stifle the growth in the IV equipment market.

The IV catheter segment is the most popular in the IV equipment market and should remain so for the foreseeable future. The IV catheter segment is expected to be worth more than US$ 2.7 billion in 2017 itself and companies are recommended to target this segment with gusto.The securement device segment and stopclocks & valve segment have single digit revenue share in the IV equipment market. While the former is projected to lose market share, the latter is on track to gain share and companies may seek to take advantage of this. The drip chamber and needleless connector segment have a revenue share of less than a tenth in the IV equipment market at the end of 2017. The needleless connector segment is predicted to lose substantial share in the near future while the drip chamber segment should fall slowly.

The IV catheter segment accounted for a revenue share approaching one-third of the IV equipment market by product type in 2017 and may gain market share going forward. The IV catheter segment is poised to be worth just under US$ 3.5 billion at the end of the forecast period in 2022, making it large enough for all stakeholders in the IV equipment market. Infusion pumps follow IV catheters in the IV equipment market and have a revenue share of approx. a sixth in terms of product type segment. Europe is the largest region in the infusion pumps market as the continent has a well-developed medical infrastructure coupled with a geriatric population that would naturally demand such treatment.

Europe is the largest region in the hospital segment of the IV equipment market but there is a close competition for the second place between APEJ and North America.

The companies profiled in the IV equipment market are AngioDynamics, Moog Inc., Terumo Corporation, C. R. Bard, ICU Medical, Smiths Group, Baxter International Inc., Fresenius SE & Co., B. Braun Melsungen AG, and Becton, Dickinson and Company.
