## üöÄ **Immediate Action Plan**

### **Step 1: Enhanced Reddit Search (15 minutes)**
Let me run a targeted Reddit search with better terms:

```python
# Better Reddit search terms:
search_terms = [
    "B Braun pump malfunction site:reddit.com",
    "Infusomat Space error site:reddit.com", 
    "IV pump free flow site:reddit.com",
    "infusion pump alarm site:reddit.com",
    "B Braun recall site:reddit.com"
]
```

### **Step 2: FDA MAUDE Database Search (10 minutes)**
- Go to FDA MAUDE database
- Search "Infusomat Space"
- Look for US incident reports

### **Step 3: Professional Forum Search (20 minutes)**
- Search nursing forums for "Infusomat problems"
- Check biomedical engineering discussions
- Look for hospital equipment complaints

---

## üéØ **Expected Evidence Types**

### **What to Look For:**
1. **Free-flow incidents** (medication overdose)
2. **Alarm failures** (missed critical alerts)
3. **Programming errors** (wrong dose delivery)
4. **Hardware malfunctions** (screen freezing, button failures)
5. **Software glitches** (unexpected shutdowns)
6. **Battery issues** (unexpected power loss)
7. **IV line disconnections** (not detected by pump)

### **Red Flags in Posts:**
- "Pump didn't alarm when it should have"
- "Patient got too much medication"
- "Screen went black during infusion"
- "Free flow incident"
- "Had to emergency stop"
- "B Braun tech had to come out multiple times"

## üîß **Let's Run Better Searches Now**

Would you like me to:

1. **üéØ Run targeted Reddit searches** with better terms?
2. **üåê Search FDA MAUDE database** for US incidents?
3. **üìö Create a research script** to automatically gather evidence?
4. **üìä Analyze your existing 264 Health Canada incidents** for patterns?

**The Health Canada data you have (264 incidents) is actually gold mine evidence - let's analyze those patterns first, then supplement with additional sources!**
