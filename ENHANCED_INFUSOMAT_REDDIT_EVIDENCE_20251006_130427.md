When we test them in the shop we cannot duplicate the issue so they get released again.

I didn't think this post would get much attention, so I didn't bother logging back in until after supper, and now I am kinda overwhelmed by all the comments and messages. I cried a little reading them though, I'm sorry my words struck such a chord in so many nurses/providers/medics/aides hearts, because it means we've all shared some of this trauma.

Rather, much of the chaos, stress, and endless crises we read about daily can be traced back to a series of decisions made by the senior leadership team in NHS England (NHSE). These leadership choices have rippled across every trust, every specialism, and nearly every colleague I’ve met, shaping t...\n\n---\n\n### EVIDENCE #8: The Gathering Gale\n\n**Relevance Score:** 48/100\n**Subreddit:** r/GATEhouse\n**Author:** u/Mycroft4114\n**Score:** 39 | **Comments:** 5\n**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/GATEhouse/comments/yx9k53/the_gathering_gale/\n**Search Query:** IV pump alarm malfunction\n\n**Content:**\nAuthor’s note:  
People seemed to enjoy the last one, and a few more ideas bubbled up.  As time passes, magic grows stronger.  Still weak overall, stronger bursts are appearing, and the effects are certainly getting harder to explain away…   

Any discrepancies between my stories and the main story should be attributed to the chaotic nature of magical backscatter when viewing other universes and not on my utter failure to coordinate any of this with PepperAntique.  

Anyway, have some!
