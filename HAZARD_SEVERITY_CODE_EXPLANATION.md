# üö® HAZARD SEVERITY CODE EXPLANATION - CANADIAN MEDICAL DEVICE INCIDENTS DATABASE

## üìã **What Are Hazard Severity Codes?**

Hazard Severity Codes are **standardized classifications** used by Health Canada to categorize the potential or actual health impact of medical device incidents. These codes help regulators and researchers understand the seriousness of device-related problems.

## üîç **The 5 Severity Levels (English/French)**

### **1. üíÄ DEATH / MORT**
- **Definition**: The medical device incident resulted in patient death
- **Significance**: Most severe classification - device malfunction caused or contributed to death
- **INFUSOMAT Data**: 1 case (0.2% of all INFUSOMAT incidents)
- **SPACE INFUSION SYSTEM**: 0 cases in this specific model

### **2. üö® POTENTIAL FOR DEATH/INJURY / POTENTIEL DE MORT / DE BLESSURES**
- **Definition**: The device malfunction had the potential to cause death or serious injury
- **Significance**: High-risk incidents that could have resulted in severe harm
- **Examples**: Device stops working during critical care, medication dosing errors, pump failures during surgery
- **INFUSOMAT Data**: 224 cases (38.1% of all INFUSOMAT incidents)
- **SPACE INFUSION SYSTEM**: 127 cases (48.1% of this model) - **HIGHEST RATE**

### **3. ü©π INJURY / BLESSURE**
- **Definition**: The device incident resulted in actual patient injury
- **Significance**: Confirmed harm occurred, but not death
- **INFUSOMAT Data**: 17 cases (2.9% of all INFUSOMAT incidents)
- **SPACE INFUSION SYSTEM**: 12 cases (4.5% of this model)

### **4. ‚úÖ MINIMAL/NO ADVERSE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES / CONSEQUENCES MINIMALES**
- **Definition**: Device malfunction occurred but with minimal or no impact on patient health
- **Significance**: Device problems that were caught early or had backup systems
- **Examples**: Alarms worked properly, staff caught error quickly, redundant systems activated
- **INFUSOMAT Data**: 344 cases (58.5% of all INFUSOMAT incidents)
- **SPACE INFUSION SYSTEM**: 123 cases (46.6% of this model)

### **5. ‚ùì UNASSIGNED / NON ATTRIBU√â**
- **Definition**: Severity has not been determined or assigned
- **Significance**: Incidents under investigation or with incomplete information
- **INFUSOMAT Data**: 2 cases (0.3% of all INFUSOMAT incidents)
- **SPACE INFUSION SYSTEM**: 2 cases (0.8% of this model)

## üìä **Critical Analysis: SPACE INFUSION SYSTEM vs All INFUSOMAT Devices**

### **üö® SPACE INFUSION SYSTEM is MORE DANGEROUS:**

| Severity Level | All INFUSOMAT | SPACE INFUSION | Difference |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **HIGH-RISK (Death + Potential + Injury)** | 41.2% | **53.4%** | +12.2% |
| **POTENTIAL FOR DEATH/INJURY** | 38.1% | **48.1%** | +10.0% |
| **INJURY** | 2.9% | **4.5%** | +1.6% |
| **MINIMAL/NO CONSEQUENCES** | 58.5% | **46.6%** | -11.9% |

## üéØ **Key Insights:**

### **1. SPACE INFUSION SYSTEM is Riskier:**
- **53.4% high-risk rate** vs 41.2% for all INFUSOMAT devices
- **48.1% potential death/injury rate** - nearly half of all incidents

### **2. Critical Problem Pattern:**
- Higher proportion of severe incidents
- Lower proportion of minimal-consequence incidents
- This suggests fundamental design or reliability issues

### **3. Regulatory Implications:**
- **264 total incidents** with this severity profile indicates ongoing safety concerns
- **48.1% potential death/injury rate** should trigger regulatory action

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **What the Codes DON'T Tell Us (The Problem You Identified):**

### **Limitations Without Event Descriptions:**
- **HOW** the device failed (pump stopped, dosing error, alarm failure?)
- **WHY** it had death/injury potential (during surgery, critical medication?)
- **WHAT** specific malfunction occurred (software bug, mechanical failure?)
- **WHEN** in the treatment process (start, middle, end of infusion?)

### **Example of What's Missing:**
```
Canadian Database Says:
"POTENTIAL FOR DEATH/INJURY - SPACE INFUSION SYSTEM - 2025-04-20"

What We Need to Know (but don't have):
"Infusion pump stopped delivering critical vasopressor medication 
during cardiac surgery. Patient's blood pressure dropped to 
dangerous levels. Pump display showed no error message. 
Manual intervention required to prevent cardiac arrest."
```

## üîç **Bottom Line:**

The **Hazard Severity Codes tell us THAT serious problems occurred** and **HOW SERIOUS they were**, but **NOT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED**. This is why the Canadian database is limited for detailed safety analysis compared to FDA MAUDE data.

**The 48.1% "POTENTIAL FOR DEATH/INJURY" rate for SPACE INFUSION SYSTEM devices is alarming, but we can't determine the specific evidence of device failures without event narratives.**
