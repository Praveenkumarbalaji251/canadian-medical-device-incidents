## üü¢ **REDDIT EVIDENCE (PROFESSIONAL VALIDATION)**

### **‚úÖ ENHANCED SEARCH RESULTS:**
- **30 RELEVANT POSTS** found with targeted search
- **HIGH ENGAGEMENT**: 27,524 total interactions
- **PROFESSIONAL SUBREDDITS**: r/BMET, r/nursing, r/medicine coverage

### **üéØ KEY EVIDENCE POST - "DANGER OF FREE FLOW ERROR":**
**Source**: u/saltytac0 in r/BMET (Biomedical Equipment Technicians)
**Quote**: *"I've been getting alot of pumps down with a complaint of 'danger of free flow error'. When we test them in the shop we cannot duplicate the issue so they get released again."*

**üö® SIGNIFICANCE**: 
- **Free flow error** = Uncontrolled medication delivery (potentially fatal)
- **Cannot duplicate in shop** = Intermittent, hard-to-diagnose problem
- **Biomedical technician** = Professional equipment expert, credible source
- **Multiple pumps** = Systemic issue, not isolated incident
