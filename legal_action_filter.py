## METHODOLOGY
This analysis identifies medical devices with high incident rates that do NOT already have existing class action lawsuits, making them potential candidates for new legal action.

**Exclusion Criteria:**
- Devices from manufacturers with known active litigation
- Devices with existing class action discussions
- Devices with public settlement announcements

## üéØ TOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR LEGAL ACTION

Based on the analysis, focus on devices with:
1. **High incident counts** (100+)
2. **Documented injuries or deaths**
3. **NO existing class action litigation**
4. **Clear manufacturer accountability**

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Detailed incident analysis** for top candidates
2. **Hospital contact** for additional documentation
3. **Expert witness consultation** on device defects
4. **Legal precedent research** for similar devices
5. **Patient outreach** for affected individuals

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è LEGAL RESEARCH STRATEGY

**For each candidate device:**
1. **PACER Search**: Federal court records for manufacturer
2. **State Court Search**: Local jurisdiction lawsuits
3. **FDA Actions**: Warning letters, recalls, safety communications
4. **Medical Literature**: Published studies on device problems
5. **Expert Networks**: Medical device engineering consultants

**Documentation to Gather:**
- Hospital incident reports
- Medical device failure analyses
- Patient medical records (with consent)
- Manufacturer safety communications
- Regulatory correspondence
