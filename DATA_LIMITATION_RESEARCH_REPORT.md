## üîç **Research Methodology & Data Source**

### **Data Source:**
- **Database**: Health Canada Medical Device Incidents (MDI) Database
- **URL**: https://health-products.canada.ca/api/medical-devices/incidents/
- **Format**: DSV (Delimiter-Separated Values) with pipe separators
- **Access**: Public API endpoint

### **Extraction Process:**
1. **Downloaded**: Full Health Canada MDI database extract
2. **Filtered**: Incidents with RECEIPT_DT between Sept 2024 - Sept 2025
3. **Result**: Only data through April 2025 was available in the database
4. **Enhanced**: Added company names, device codes, risk classifications

### **Data Fields Analyzed:**
- **INCIDENT_ID**: Unique incident identifier
- **RECEIPT_DT**: Date Health Canada received the report (our primary filter)
- **INCIDENT_DT**: Date the actual incident occurred
- **TRADE_NAME**: Commercial device name
- **COMPANY_NAME**: Manufacturer/distributor
- **HAZARD_SEVERITY_CODE_E**: Severity level (Death, Injury, Potential, etc.)
- **RISK_CLASSIFICATION**: Device risk class (1-4)

## ü§î **Why Only 8 Months? Possible Explanations**

### **1. Health Canada Reporting Lag**
- **Typical delay**: 2-3 months for incident processing and publication
- **Administrative review**: Incidents undergo validation before publication
- **Data quality checks**: Health Canada may hold recent data for verification

### **2. Database Update Frequency**
- **Quarterly updates**: Health Canada may publish data quarterly
- **Batch processing**: Recent incidents may be in processing pipeline
- **System maintenance**: Database updates may be pending

### **3. Regulatory Changes**
- **Reporting timeline changes**: New regulations may affect publication schedule
- **Process improvements**: Health Canada may have updated their data release process
- **COVID-19 impact**: Pandemic may have affected reporting timelines

### **4. Technical Considerations**
- **Data extraction timing**: Our extraction captured available data at specific point
- **API limitations**: Public API may not immediately reflect all current data
- **Database synchronization**: Internal vs public database sync delays

## üìä **Analysis Validity & Limitations**

### **‚úÖ What Our Analysis IS Valid For:**
- **Trend identification** in the 8-month period
- **Device safety patterns** during Sept 2024 - April 2025
- **Company performance** comparison in available timeframe
- **Severity distribution** analysis for covered period
- **Regulatory insights** for the specific 8-month window

### **‚ö†Ô∏è What Our Analysis CANNOT Determine:**
- **Current safety trends** (May-Oct 2025)
- **Annual patterns** (missing 5 months)
- **Recent device improvements** or deteriorations
- **Complete 12-month company performance**
- **Latest regulatory impacts** on incident reporting

### **üéØ Confidence Levels:**
- **High confidence**: Device rankings, company profiles, severity patterns
- **Medium confidence**: Monthly trends (limited to 8 months)
- **Low confidence**: Annual projections, current state assessments

---

## üîÑ **Recommendations for Complete Analysis**

### **Immediate Actions:**
1. **Re-run extraction** monthly to capture new data
2. **Set up monitoring** for Health Canada database updates
3. **Document data gaps** in all analysis reports
4. **Qualify findings** with temporal limitations

### **Future Data Strategy:**
1. **Automated updates**: Schedule monthly data refreshes
2. **Gap analysis**: Track when missing months become available
3. **Validation**: Cross-reference with other safety databases
4. **Trend analysis**: Compare patterns when full 12-month data available

---

## üìà **Current Analysis Impact**

### **Still Valuable Because:**
- **Large sample size**: 6,970 incidents provide statistically significant insights
- **Recent data**: September 2024 - April 2025 represents most current available trends
- **Comprehensive coverage**: All major device types and manufacturers included
- **Quality data**: Enhanced with company and device classification information

### **Key Insights Remain Valid:**
- **High-risk devices**: Insulin pumps, infusion systems show consistent problems
- **Company rankings**: Tandem Diabetes, Boston Scientific safety concerns persist
- **Severity patterns**: Death rates and injury distributions are meaningful
- **Device categories**: Medical pump safety issues are well-documented

## üéØ **Dashboard Usage Guidelines**

### **When Using Our Dashboard:**
1. **Remember the timeframe**: All data is September 2024 - April 2025
2. **Interpret trends carefully**: Monthly trends only cover 8 months
3. **Consider recency**: Latest incidents are from April 2025
4. **Use for comparative analysis**: Device/company comparisons remain valid
5. **Plan for updates**: Anticipate data refresh when newer data available

### **Best Practices:**
- ‚úÖ Use for identifying problematic devices and companies
- ‚úÖ Analyze severity patterns and risk distributions  
- ‚úÖ Compare relative safety performance
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Avoid making current state conclusions
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't extrapolate annual trends from 8 months
- ‚ùå Don't assume completeness for regulatory decisions

## üîç **Next Steps for Complete Picture**

1. **Monitor Health Canada** for database updates
2. **Re-extract data** monthly to capture new incidents
3. **Validate findings** when complete 12-month data available
4. **Update analysis** to include missing months when released
5. **Cross-reference** with international safety databases
